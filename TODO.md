(DONE) block search should have a "*" to search for all blocks. in gui can even be represented as a checkbox that when checked disabled the input field (but also disallows setting max amount to 0)

Implementation: --search-blocks "*" triggers index-all mode. GUI has "Index ALL blocks" checkbox that disables text field and passes "*".
