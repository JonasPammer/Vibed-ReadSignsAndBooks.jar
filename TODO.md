* enhance mcfunction to give shulker_box's filled with books.
it should create one shulker box for each author, and each author should get its own determnistic color,
and item name also of the author.
of course some authors will have more than 3*9 books, so it must become multiple shulker boxes

* create a new all_signs.mcfunction that has a /setblock ~ ~ ~ ... for all signs
each sign increases the coordinate by one, making the signs appear next to each other.
duplicate sign texts should also be placed, behind the respective sign that already contains it.
