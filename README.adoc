** Example: `My_Book_(3)_by_Joe~minecraft_chest~-10_65_20.stendhal`
** Stendhal format preserves Minecraft formatting codes (§ codes)
* `books/.duplicates/` - directory containing duplicate books (same content, different locations)
* `all_signs.txt` - all signs found in the world, one per line
** Example: `Chunk [31, 31]	(-2 75 -5)		Line 1! ⚠ Line 2! ☀`
* `all_books.txt` - all books in Stendhal format, separated by `#region` and `#endregion` markers for VSCode folding
* `all_books.csv` - CSV export of all books with metadata
* `all_signs.csv` - CSV export of all signs with metadata
