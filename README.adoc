== Features

This tool scans Minecraft world files and extracts:

* *Written books* (with title and author)
* *Writable books* (book and quill)
* *Signs* with text (all variants: regular, hanging, wall signs)
* *Books in containers:* chests, barrels, shulker boxes, bundles, item frames, minecarts, boats, and more
* *Books in containers of containers* (e.g., inside bundles in frames, inside shulker boxes in chests)
* *Books in player inventories* and ender chests
* *Duplicate tracking:* Saves duplicate books to `.duplicates/` folder instead of skipping them

== Usage

=== Quick Start (The Easiest Way)

Double Click or run without arguments to open the GUI Wrapper.

=== Quick Start (The Easy Way)

. *Find your Minecraft world folder:*
+
* Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\YourWorldName`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/YourWorldName`
* Linux: `~/.minecraft/saves/YourWorldName`

. *Run the tool:*
+
[source,bash]
----
java -jar ReadSignsAndBooks.jar --world "C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\YourWorldName"
----
+
Or simply drag and drop your world folder into the same directory as the JAR and run it.

. *Find your results* in the newly created `ReadBooks/` folder!

=== What You'll Get

The tool creates output in `ReadBooks/YYYY-MM-DD/`:

* `books/` - directory containing individual Stendhal format files for each unique book
** Each book is saved as: `Title_(PageCount)_by_Author~location~coords.stendhal`
** Example: `My_Book_(3)_by_Joe~minecraft_chest~-10_65_20.stendhal`
** Stendhal format preserves Minecraft formatting codes (§ codes)
* `books/.duplicates/` - directory containing duplicate books (same content, different locations)
* `all_signs.txt` - all signs found in the world, one per line
** Example: `Chunk [31, 31]	(-2 75 -5)		Line 1! ⚠ Line 2! ☀`
* `all_books.txt` - all books in Stendhal format, separated by `#region` and `#endregion` markers for VSCode folding
* `all_books.csv` - CSV export of all books with metadata
* `all_signs.csv` - CSV export of all signs with metadata
* *Ready-to-use Minecraft Datapacks* (exactly four folders are generated every run):
** `readbooks_datapack_1_13/` - Minecraft 1.13-1.14.3 (pack_format 4, `functions/`)
** `readbooks_datapack_1_14/` - Minecraft 1.14.4-1.19.4 (pack_format 4, `functions/`)
** `readbooks_datapack_1_20_5/` - Minecraft 1.20.5-1.20.6 (pack_format 41, `functions/`)
** `readbooks_datapack_1_21/` - Minecraft 1.21+ (pack_format 48, `function/`)
** Each datapack contains:
*** `pack.mcmeta` with the correct `pack_format` and a human-readable description (open it to confirm you picked the right version)
*** `data/readbooks/(functions|function)/books.mcfunction` – `give @p written_book…` commands
*** `data/readbooks/(functions|function)/signs.mcfunction` – `setblock` commands that reconstruct every sign
*** Identical folder layout every run so you can script uploads or CI validation
** _No_ other datapack versions are produced, so your automation can assert on this fixed list.
*Quick reference table:*

[cols="2,2,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Datapack folder|Minecraft versions|pack_format|Function folder
|`readbooks_datapack_1_13`|1.13 – 1.14.3|4|`data/readbooks/functions/`
|`readbooks_datapack_1_14`|1.14.4 – 1.19.4|4|`data/readbooks/functions/`
|`readbooks_datapack_1_20_5`|1.20.5 – 1.20.6|41|`data/readbooks/functions/`
|`readbooks_datapack_1_21`|1.21+|48|`data/readbooks/function/`

* `logs.txt` - program debug logs
* `summary.txt`
** Breakdown by container type (chests, shulker boxes, villagers, etc.)
** Breakdown by location type (block entities, entities, players)
** Processing time and performance metrics

=== Using the Datapacks in Minecraft

. *Match your version.* Pick the folder from the table above that targets your Minecraft build. The `pack.mcmeta` inside each folder clearly states the supported range and `pack_format`—open it if you are unsure.
. *Copy the folder into your world’s datapacks directory.*
+
* Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\YourWorldName\datapacks\`
* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/YourWorldName/datapacks/`
* Linux: `~/.minecraft/saves/YourWorldName/datapacks/`
+
[source,bash]
----
# Example: load the 1.21+ datapack that was generated today
cp -r ReadBooks/2025-11-23/readbooks_datapack_1_21 ~/.minecraft/saves/YourWorldName/datapacks/
----
. *Verify the contents before launching Minecraft (optional but recommended).*
+
Ensure `pack.mcmeta` reports the correct `pack_format`, and check that both `books.mcfunction` and `signs.mcfunction` live under `data/readbooks/function(s)/`. This catches accidental copies of the wrong folder.
. *Reload datapacks inside Minecraft and run the functions.*
+
[source,mcfunction]
----
/reload
/function readbooks:books   # gives every unique written book back to you
/function readbooks:signs   # recreates every exported sign near your player
----
+
Signs are placed along a positive-X strip with duplicates offset on Z, so pick a flat area before running the command.
. *Repeat for other versions if you share worlds.* Because the folder names are deterministic (`readbooks_datapack_<version>`), you can keep multiple versions side-by-side and enable only the one you need via `/datapack enable`.

TIP: Need to audit the commands without opening Minecraft? Open `books.mcfunction`/`signs.mcfunction` in any editor—they are plain text files with one command per line.

== Development

[source,cmd]
----
gradle build
----

Run directly with Gradle:

[source,bash]
----
gradle run --args="--world /path/to/world"
----

To use custom JVM arguments for large worlds:

[source,bash]
----
gradle run "-Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx10G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200" --args="--world /path/to/world"
----

=== Testing

The integration test uses real minecraft world(s).

[source,bash]
----
gradle test
----

Afterwards, you can look at the generated files in the `build/test-worlds/*/ReadBooks/` folder, e.g. link:./build/test-worlds/1_21_10-44-3/ReadBooks/[]
