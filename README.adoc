== Features

This tool scans Minecraft world files and extracts:

* *Written books* (with title and author)
* *Writable books* (book and quill)
* *Signs* with text (all variants: regular, hanging, wall signs)
* *Books in containers:* chests, barrels, shulker boxes, bundles, item frames, minecarts, boats, and more
* *Books in containers of containers* (e.g., inside bundles in frames, inside shulker boxes in chests)
* *Books in player inventories* and ender chests
* *Duplicate tracking:* Saves duplicate books to `.duplicates/` folder instead of skipping them
* *Book generation tracking:* Tracks whether books are originals, copies, copies of copies, or tattered
** Generation metadata included in CSV, Stendhal files, and mcfunction commands
** Enables understanding the provenance and genealogy of duplicated books

=== Book Generation Tracking

ReadSignsAndBooks now tracks the **generation** (copy tier) of written books, extracted from Minecraft's NBT data:

* *Original (0):* First signed book created from a book & quill
* *Copy of Original (1):* Copied from an original book
* *Copy of Copy (2):* Copied from a copy (cannot be copied further)
* *Tattered (3):* Maximum copy tier (rare, cannot be copied)

This generation information is included in:

* *CSV exports:* New `Generation` and `GenerationLabel` columns
* *Stendhal files:* New `generation:` and `generation_label:` metadata fields
* *Minecraft commands:* Generation NBT preserved in all `/give` commands (1.13+, 1.14+, 1.20.5+, 1.21+)

This feature helps archivists and server administrators understand which books are original works versus copies, enabling better preservation and provenance tracking.

== Usage

. link:https://github.com/JonasPammer/Vibed-ReadSignsAndBooks.jar/releases/latest/download/ReadSignsAndBooks.jar[*Download ReadSignsAndBooks.jar*]

=== Quick Start (The Easy Way)

. *Find your Minecraft world folder:*
+
* Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\YourWorldName`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/YourWorldName`
* Linux: `~/.minecraft/saves/YourWorldName`

. *Run the tool:*
+
[source,bash]
----
java -jar ReadSignsAndBooks.jar --world "C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\YourWorldName"
----
+
Or simply drag and drop your world folder into the same directory as the JAR and run it.

. *Find your results* in the newly created `ReadBooks/` folder!

=== What You'll Get

The tool creates output in `ReadBooks/YYYY-MM-DD/`:

* `books/` - directory containing individual Stendhal format files for each unique book
** Each book is saved as: `Title_(PageCount)_by_Author~location~coords.stendhal`
** Example: `My_Book_(3)_by_Joe~minecraft_chest~-10_65_20.stendhal`
** Stendhal format preserves Minecraft formatting codes (§ codes)
* `books/.duplicates/` - directory containing duplicate books (same content, different locations)
* `all_signs.txt` - all signs found in the world, one per line
** Example: `Chunk [31, 31]	(-2 75 -5)		Line 1! ⚠ Line 2! ☀`
* `all_books.txt` - all books in Stendhal format, separated by `#region` and `#endregion` markers for VSCode folding
* `all_books.csv` - CSV export of all books with metadata (includes generation columns)
* `all_signs.csv` - CSV export of all signs with metadata
* `all_books-1_13.mcfunction` - Minecraft 1.13+ commands to recreate all books via `/give` commands
* `all_books-1_14.mcfunction` - Minecraft 1.14+ commands to recreate all books via `/give` commands
* `all_books-1_20_5.mcfunction` - Minecraft 1.20.5+ commands to recreate all books via `/give` commands
* `all_books-1_21.mcfunction` - Minecraft 1.21+ commands to recreate all books via `/give` commands
* `logs.txt` - program debug logs
* `summary.txt`
** Breakdown by container type (chests, shulker boxes, villagers, etc.)
** Breakdown by location type (block entities, entities, players)
** Processing time and performance metrics

== Development

[source,cmd]
----
gradle build
----

Run directly with Gradle:

[source,bash]
----
gradle run --args="--world /path/to/world"
----

To use custom JVM arguments for large worlds:

[source,bash]
----
gradle run "-Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx10G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200" --args="--world /path/to/world"
----

=== Testing

The integration test uses real minecraft world(s).

[source,bash]
----
gradle test
----

Afterwards, you can look at the generated files in the `build/test-worlds/*/ReadBooks/` folder, e.g. link:./build/test-worlds/1_21_10-44-3/ReadBooks/[]
