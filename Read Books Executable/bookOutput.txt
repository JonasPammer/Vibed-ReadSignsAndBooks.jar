Someone killed my animals.
Can they be banned? No Animals are not loggable.
Protect your animals with a residence that has "butcher" set to false. Or box your animals in completely.

Page 8: Someone is being rude, can they be banned? No, You're both adults, Deal with it.

What IS considered harrasment:
- Spamming /tpa [player]
- Spawn killing in their 
  home
- Creating a res over their 
  Buildings
- Repeated killing in the
  East
Page 9: I teleported to a residence but it was a fall trap, it stole my stuff. Can they be banned? No, a fall trap is not against the rules, even in the east.
Generally ask before teleporting to an unknown resedence.
Try Asking for your stuff back nicely....

         The

     Greatest

       Book

       Ever



01101010010101010010
Page 1: Chapter 1

One day, you found this book. It was an ancient book filled with strange symbols and phrases.




You turned the page.
Page 2: On the second page, you saw one of the strange phrases. You decided to read it aloud:



   MOOSE


Nothing happens. You turn the page.
Page 3: §iChapter 2

You fall into a hole in the desert with no way out. You just ate your last pie and you hear a growl come from outside the hole. What do you do?

A. (Turn to page 5)
B. (Turn to page 6)
Page 4:       Choice A

You call for help and suddenly, 7 people show up in the hole with you. They blow it up with TnT, killing you in the process.


It's ok, though, because you come back to life and run back to the hole.
Page 5:       Choice B

You don't do what Dolo did and instead you just sit in the hole forever. 

Just..

Sitting..


Forever..   (you lose)
Page 6: Chapter 3

How many apples does it take to zipper?


A. Cheese

B. The square root of      nothing.

C. Quack

 Answer is on page 9
Page 7: 
        The End



Thanks for reading and I hope you are a bit confused.

Page 0: Brandi,

We've haven't know each other for very long, but it's been an awesome time so for.  I'm glad that we could be there for each other when times got tough.

I still remember the first time I talked to 
Page 1: you, even though you probably don't remember.  I gave you a diamond pickaxe with a weird ass name, Fuck Off Something is what it was called, and you were by jackhair's trailer park.

That's the stupid shit i remember, but I forget the other 
Page 2: stuff.

I'm typing this as I'm talking to you, and Erin isn't better than us.

Anyway, I hope that we can stay friends forever like we've been saying.  Even after we're done playing minecraft.
Page 3: Come to think of it, we don't even play minecraft together anyway!  We just talk.  Highlights of my day.

And seriously, if you ever need to talk to me, you can just call.  Anytime.  

I'm bad at writing this shit.
Page 4: Anyway, you're fuckin awesome and don't let anyone tell you any different.

IN the Information age a castle was concieved, a castle of epic proportions. The castle lay atop a singluar peak surrounded by lakes of lava with boulder sized stepping stones afloat on the surface.
Page 1: The castle which can be clearly seen on the map lies in the east region of the world, its scorched  earth surroundings go out for miles. the flora and fauna have all but dissapeared and a lone path is the only lead to discovering the castle while on foot.
Page 2: Of the inhabitants, no one has truely been seen within its dark stone encrusted walls. Some claim to have seen a lone stranger wandering the castle, of which whom was rumored to have built it, this has never been proven.

I can't believe these people don't know that my player alt "ColeCross" is really me! I can't be server admin 24/7 ffs.. I need to let loose now and again, and I can't let Lars get credit for all the best racist jokes! I wonder when they will..

I wonder what happens if a bank runs out of money.  Have you ever read about the bank runs in the 1930s?  Maybe.... maybe it makes more sense for the bank NOT to have much money.  If there's not much money, there can't be a run on the bank!!
Page 5: Holy crap, I am almost positive Alan Greenspan said something about this back in the 1980s.  I will try to give that a shot and see if this prevents a financial meltdown later down the road.

Page 1: I first entered the nether with childishness. it was a very suprising world comprised of what i belive to be the minced meat of the damned souls whom have died.

It was no shock that this place with-held strange creatures the like of which ive never seen.
Page 2: I started my studies on the most common of creatures found here; The Zombie Pigman.

The anatomy of this creature resembles a very strong bi-pedal man with the colouring and form of a common pig. most if not all have the ability to use tools.
Page 3: They carry a golden sword, sometimes enchated; of which they smite they're foes.

Hunting in packs these creatures can get very aggressive and it is not wise to trigger they're defensive state.


Page 4: The Blaze is a race of sentient beings comprised of hardened glowstone rods, these rods often catch fire from their sheer compression levels, they are very good fuel.

The Blaze usually only summon around a central summoning block found on nether fortress
Page 5: Ghasts are the most feared of all creatures in the nether, their howling crys shock you to the very bone.

They shoot fireballs out their mouths which are extreemly explosive.
watch out!

they are very easy to kill with a bow an arrow and drop ghast tears
Page 6: Something i have only rarely found are The Magma Slimes/Cubes

much like the overworld equivilent, they come in varying sizes.

Not much to them other than they are guite hot and will burn on touch

Page 0: To unpair portals that are too close in the overworld, you need to go through your portal and deactivate the connected portal. Teleport back home and go through it again. If there are no active portals in the area, it will make a new one that
Page 1: connects to yours in the over world.

Then find all the deactivated portals and reignite them.

Their portals will go back to theirs, and yours will go to yours,
Problem solved.
(I've done this with several people)

Page 0: ===================     LUCY BELL LANE
===================

Calico's most distinguished and long time resident was Lucy Bell Lane (1874-1967).

Known as the "Queen of Calico", Lucy lived at Calico for nearly 67 years.
Page 1: Of her many gifts, she is most remembered for her warm hospitality and vivid storytelling of the historic Calico silver camp.

Lucy was indeed part of the history of Calico and was an accomplished prospector.
Page 2: Lucy Bell King arrived at Calico with her parents, her two brothers and sister in 1884, three years after the initial discovery of silver.

In 1892 at the age of 18, she married John Lane. They bought a grocery store which briefly prospered
Page 3: but then quickly declined as a result of a slumping silver market. The Lanes left Calico in 1899 and returned for good in 1916, making the Lane's store building their home.

In 1920, the Lanes moved into the old courthouse & post office building, which
Page 4: would be Lucy's home until 1965.

John Lane died in 1934 & Lucy died in 1967 at the age of 93.

The stench of his bulging penis made Fagsterdog's blood pressure increase, making his dick explode like a rocket taking out half of the United Kingdom.             ...
Page 2: The Glaswegian shrieked in his native tongue "EEUUURRRIIIII WHATTA YA FACKEN DOO THA FER YA RUDDY CUNT, YER FOOKEN DEAD NOW BOI".

Fagsterdog saw the anger in this guys nipples and fled through the alleyways looking for a quiet...

467 Imperial date.

Ortheus VII Succeeds the throne after the death of his father. Ortheus, the product of inbreeding, show signs of...illnesses
Page 2: Ortheus VII has been ruling for 4 years now. Most people relastively close to the Emperor are fully aware of his schizophrenia. The commoners are not sure, but many believe so. The Empire has waged more wars in the past 4 years than
Page 3: in the previous 40 years.The treasury has been depleted, food growing scarce and talk of a peasant rebellions to the north and an ethnic rebellion to the south. The Empire is nearing the brink of ruin. Various Lords and prominent figures..
Page 4: begin to talk. One of them is our Eternal Lord.
 
Our Eternal Lord, Wilhelm III, has risen to prominence as of late. Having successfully graduating top of his class in the Imperial Naval Academy and...
Page 5: his family having climbed it's way back up from financial ruin, thanks to his uncle's death allowing his father to take over the family as patriarch. Under Wilhem's father, the family managed to revive local industry and invest in more...
Page 6: infrastructure, a gamble at the time that would pay off big later on. He also expanded the reach of the Empire by colonizing new lands. Lands where his son Wilhem III would later move the family capital to and where he would be buried.
Page 7: Imperial Year 471

The start of war.

Ortheus, growing ever more insane, is furious. The gossip of the Lords and wealthy merchants has reached his ears. Ortheus begins a purge that would see 10,000 nobles,
Page 8: merchants, and commoners executed. Entire families eradicated and laws are put in place to make it illegal to speak lies against the Imperial family. 
The remaining figures powerful enough and bold enough to stand against Ortheus..
Page 9: meet one final time. During this convention the vast majority agree that somethng must be done, so they decide to support previous Emperor's nephew to be placed on the throne in a coup. 
His name was Artefic.
Page 10: Artefic, having the support of many of the nobility, addresses the Imperial Court. the Imperial court is mainly for show now, previously it was used as a legeslative body to act on decisions such as succession, war, and trade. The act
Page 11: would be no less symbolic though. 

In his address to the court Artefic condemned the new laws and resent executions as a black stain on the Empire's noble history. The Imperial Court, packed with Ortheus' side...
Page 12: was not moved, however the speech was heard around the Empire. Peasant to nobles had began to stand together against the Emperor with encouragement from the recent speech. Ortheus was silent, but swift. Sending a legion to arrest
Page 13: Artefic at his castle under the charges of spreading "lies" about the Imperial family. However, Artefic was already 2 steps ahead of his demented cousin had sent a spy into the Emperor's circle months ahead of the speech.
Page 14: Having already recieved information of the impending attack, Artefic called on his friend, our Lord, Wilhelm III to do the impossible. Defeat the invading force.
Wilhelm would have to move troops and supplies without notice of Imperial..
Page 15: forces in only a months time. The army sent by the Empire was 10,000 strong, and at best The Rebels could hope for 6,000 under supplied troops. Wilhelm would have many sleepless nights ahead. 
Page 16: Imperial Year 471

The first battle.

Having managed to pull off the seemingly possible Wilhelm managed to bring in 5,500 troops, get defensive fortifications built in the forests and supply the castle..
Page 17: Wilhelm knew he couldn't defeat the well trained, well supplied Empire head on so he devised a plan to strike them with a small force in the forests ahead of the castle. Enough to thin their ranks some, but not enough to alert them to a larger 
Page 18: force in the castle.

Wilhelm's gorilla attacks in the forest thinned the Imperial forces from 10,000 to 9,553, using only small scouting parties and well placed traps through the forest. Less than what was hoped for Wilhelm  
Page 19: had to devise another plan, for Imperial forces would be on the castle in 3 days. 

Wilhelm thought of a genius plan that night while in the tavern. He would take all the alcohol in the castle and the villages nearby and stage
Page 20: a large shipment for the Imperial forces to capture. This was a risky plan, because he knew without that alcohol his weaker and non battle hardened troops would quickly lose nerve, but Wilhelm decided to make the gamble. 3 days later the Imperials
Page 21: reached the walls, where they quickly pillaged everything outside the walls, including the staged alcohol caravan near the gates. 
 
 Later that night Wilhelm snuck his troops out of the rear and side gates and charged the ...
Page 22: enemy camp. Wilhelm's plan worked perfectly. Not only were a large portion of Imperial forces drunk, but the security around the gates were relaxed aswell. That night was known as the begining of the end for the Imperials.
Page 23: Wilhelm then lead rebel forces on the same road the Imperials took towards the capital. Having assumed the legion would win, or at least not be utterly shattered so quickly. Defense in the capital was nothing but inexperienced militia.
Page 24: The Imperial Capital was quickly captured, however Ortheus would manage to escape. The war would drag on for another 3 years all across the Empire until 474 when Ortheus would take his own life during the final seige of his island fortress, Izo. 
Page 25: For his tremendous service for leading the Rebel forces as Supreme Commander of Rebel forces, Wilhelm was granted the title of Archduke and granted Independent member state of the Empire. Only 4 other leaders would be granted such an..
Page 26: honor in history. 

Wilhelm now 27 and the leader of his own nation, decided to move the capital to the colony where his father retired and died before the war. There among the mountains he would erect a castle and village which would soon
Page 27: bustle into the City we live in today.

Page 0: Its is very seldom that meree ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer. A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity--but that would be asking too much of
Page 1: fate! Still I would proudly declare that there is something queer about it. Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted? John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage. John is practical in the extreme.
Page 2: He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition , and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures. John is a physician , and perhaps--(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is 
Page 3: dead paper and great relief to my mind--) perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster. You see he does not believe I am sick! And what can one do?  If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures freinds and relatives that there is
Page 4: really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency--what is one to do? My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same thing. So I take phosphates or phosphites--whicheve
Page 5: it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to "work" until I am well again. Personally, I disagree with their ideas. Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change would do me good. 
Page 6: But what is one to do? I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good deal--having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition. I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more 
Page 7: society stimulus--but John says that very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad. So I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from
Page 8: the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of seperate little houses for the gardeners and people. There is a delicious garden! 
Page 9: I never saw such a garden--large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them. There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now. There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the
Page 10: heirs and coheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years. That spoils my ghostlines, I am afraid, but I don't care--there is something strange about the house--I can feel it. I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a
Page 11: draught, and shut the window. I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I thinkit is due to this nervous condition. But John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control
Page 12: myself--before him, at least, and that makes me very tired. I don't like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings! But John would not hear of it.
Page 13: He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another. He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction. I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes 
Page 14: all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more. He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. "Your exercise depends on your strenght, my dear" said he, "and your food
Page 15: somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time." SO we took the nursery at the top of the house. It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galor. It was nursery first and then
Page 16: playroom and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls. The paint and paper look as if a boys' school had used it. It is stripped off--the paper--in great patches all around the 
Page 17: the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse papers in my life.  One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin. It is dull enough to confuse
Page 18: the eyein the following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide--plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard of
Page 19: contradictions. The color is repellent, almost revolting; a smouldering unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow -turning sunlight. It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places a sickly sulphur tint in others. NO wonder the children hated it! I should 
Page 20: hate it myself if I had to live in this room long. There comes John, and I must put this away,--he hates to have me write a word.

Page 0: It was a muggy morning in the great city of Conquestadors. The morning stench of blood and rotting flesh awakens me. I arise quickly to see the sun meet me face to face. When all of a sudden, there is a group of 5 men standing about my body ready to 
Page 1: dismantle me limb from limb. I can see the hate in their eyes and their grips tighten around the leather wraps securely holding swords half the size of a bear. For what could they be so mad about to reach this point. Well I'll tell ya it was the point of 
Page 2: war that nobody ever thought was possible. The year was 2128 and the world was at a standstill as Casma the last surviving species of alien catastrophic invasion as a last resort for their own survival coaxed human rebels into an allegiance that would 
Page 3: benefit only the most grutesk survivors of the planet. Only the vile would survive to live among these aliens in rule of the world. So this they thought until, they met Sergie the smiter of lox giants & inventor of meta physical changing elixors by the
Page 4: thousands. His power left him alone standing. Now Sergie is faced with some infidels that just didn't bother believing the myths. I quickly dash my left foot back side step drop down and sweep the legs from under my oppenents and my leverage of stability 
Page 5: gains I propel a jab into ones liver as well and a keen shot to ther others kidney. Now its just time to show off as I grab my trousers & shirt, leaving the men groveling over the floor. The next thing I'm doing is bringing an elixir up before me to 
Page 6: endulge in this heavy toxin, i warn the men you better run.... This is not some ordinary fixer upper magic drink. This is my own concoction that has been so true, to have me as the only one rebellion left against an overwhelming force for everyone else. 
Page 7: When the elixir mixes into my bloodstream not only am i increasing stronger with every muscle contraction. The blows destroy the cartledge & shatter the bones of my oppenents. These men are men no longer, I feel satisfied knowing their death saves
Page 8: lives of those away safe in their homes. This world once was made true until the aliens only fueled a fire while humanity layed the logs at their feet for decades without even knowing they existed. Nuclear power plants became the headquarters, satelites
Page 9: remote housing of their ships own technology. As they watched and manipulated the information to feed into their will to land and have an accompaning force. They indeed found those souls willing to do these deeds for the lavish promises of positions with

Page 0: Introduction

Hey guys! Manda here :) Before you read this little short story I wrote for my friends and everyone in WA, you should probably be warned :P  I tried to write creatively in the past but couldn't keep my interest past a few pages.. might lose 
Page 1: interest with this too but I promise to try and finish what I started. I also haven't written anything to be read by anyone since school and college.. so my punctuation and grammar will probably be off but I assure you that it is at the very least
Page 2:  readable. lol it's not just chicken scratch. This scifi short was 'strongly' influenced by a short titled 'The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect'  written by Roger Williams which is free to read on the author's site without any downloads or payments or 
Page 3: any bs.. just google it if you're interested and it should be the top link. If you do read it you'll notice that our stories have a ton of similarities.  "Why the hell should I read your 'not even' amateur version when the good stuff is online for free?" 
Page 4: you might be wondering. Well for one I don't see a reason why you can't read both :P. They're both free (no need to pirate, rmj!)  Second, you love me.. we both know this so don't deny it cause we both know that'd be a lie.  Third, I tried to go in a
Page 5: different direction than Mr. Williams did with his novel. Mr. Williams is a software programmer with more knowledge than me about computers and... programming.. and his work reflects that. His work is strongly influenced by Asimov's literature and concept
Page 6: of the 3 laws of robotics (remember Will Smith in iRobot? That.) I, on the other hand, am a typical nerd with nerdy interests like scifi/fantasy movies, books, and games so my influences are a bit different. My interests are broader and hopefully this 
Page 7: novel will reflect that. The last thing I'd like to say is I'll take on any criticism on my writing or the story itself. Like it.. hate it.. feel free to let me know! :)
Page 8: Chapter 1
Her name was Clara Anderson, and she was an amazing woman. Before she was thrust into the New World, like everybody else, she was considered exemplary. At a young age she learned about the bush from her loving parents ,  Ben and Angela.
Page 9: They taught her about the beauty of the natural world, how to survive it's harshness, and the responsibility to be it's steward. 

That was in the past.

Clara loved the camping trips she had with her parents. To her it was fun and exciting to
Page 10: experience everything head on and when adulthood slowly creeped into her life the wonder she held for the world didn't fade. She had stepped into her parents shoes in a sense and was very proud of her knowledge and donned the role of a protector, for not
Page 11: everyone saw the value of such a lifestyle and even worse, did everything in their power to ruin it. Humanity, as a whole, was more concerned with other things than silly trees or wild animals.

Clara was an overachiever. One
Page 12: would think that a person with a fiery passion would find their life lacking in other areas, but Clara didn't fit into that category. She was an excellent student, later earning a PhD in environmental geochemistry which afforded her a career working with
Page 13: what she loves.  She was always physically fit, excersizing in ways most people at the gym couldn't understand or chose not to.  She had learned how to defend herself at a young age from her father and continued that education through brazilian jiu-jitsu 
Page 14: so she very well knew the difference between sculpting a body for display, and raw functional strength. Clara had also been a socially outgoing person ; the fact that most men would find her fetching physically and mentally stimulating only cemented her 
Page 15: status on the social ladder. She was an alpha in every sense of the word. 

There was almost nothing left but anger now, anger and disgust for the Machine, the New World, and everything in it. The last century had even threatened her sanity
Page 16: but she refused to go down without a fight.. or even an opponent.

She woke to the sound of life stirring outside her forest cottage.  Light slowly grew into the world and beams started to pierce the vale of canopies overhead causing wildlife to shift and
Page 17: adjust. It was morning. Most people would call it a beautiful day, but then most people were not Clara, and Clara was definitely not most people.

She got up and began her morning ritual of cleaning herself and preparing for the day. Today was an 
Page 18: important day because she had been finally granted an audience with the Advisors and she wanted to be prepared. They would hear what she had to say alright, whether they liked it or not.. which they didn't ofcourse.

Her shower released 
Page 19: jets of scented water and she allowed herself a brief moment of bliss as she reminisced of a life long gone in the wild, and the wonders she hoped still existed somewhere. Donned in a white microfiber robe and still dripping wet, she tip-toed to the 
Page 20: kitchen and set a pot of water on the tiny coffee burner before she began preparing breakfast. She had always enjoyed the little things which is why she chose to live a simple, long forgotten way of life. There were some, like her, who still clung to a 
Page 21: simple, old world lifestyle ; but Clara rarely found anything in common with those people. The majority of them were simply experiencing something new to them which she found hilarious considering the circumstances. A smaller group of people had a similar
Page 22: distaste for the changes everyone was forced to acclimate, but they had long since lost any desire to resist. Some of them were borderline insane, hanging over the edge of a cliff that threatened to give way at any moment and their way of life was a means
Page 23: of hanging on. Fewer still were people who did have the strength or the balls to do anything other than indulge ; but Clara only socialized now if she felt she could learn a piece of knowledge she might use to her advantage with the Advisors.. everyone 
Page 24: else was fucking nuts in her book.

Two eggs were gently plopped into a small pot of boiling water before she pulled a leftover grapefruit half from the fridge. Breakfast would be ready soon so she sat down and waited on the eggs with a mug of coffee 
Page 25: -- black. She stared at nothing and quickly re-ran through the things she wanted to discuss with the Advisors in her mind. Current events were pointless ; people were ecstatic about all the wonderful horse shit they could do now! Morality? Even Clara 
Page 26: didn't care whether the changes were morally laudable or not and nobody else did either.. nobody important anyways. Logic was definitely out the window because even a fool would suggest that it is quite logical to be immortal. Aberrancy was her only 
Page 27: window. This was unnatural, this was wrong, this 'felt' wrong, everything was fucking wrong! Clara would scream in someone's face if she could.

She ate her breakfast slowly and gazed out the window. She listened to the sounds of flycatchers and 
Page 28: finches, birds native to her old home of Pennsylvania, as they sang on their morning prowl. Various pines, and maples, and birches, and oaks covered the hilly landscape among others she could easily name on sight. It was a very accurate representation of 
Page 29: how she remembered the place where she grew up.

But it was a lie.

You see, Clara could have chosen any location she wanted to be her surroundings. Or none. Or something entirely alien if she willed it. Anybody 
Page 30: could -- and they did. The New World was an inescapable cyberspace where humanity now resided and matters of the physical realm were no longer a concern for anyone. Neither was death ; you couldn't die in cyberspace even if you tried, and people 
Page 31: definitely did try, because the Machine simply wouldn't allow it.The Machine was a derogatory nickname for the entity responsible for all of this -- Actual Intelligence.  "Fuck 'im" Clara thought to herself, barely refraining for spitting the words out.
Page 32: Actual Intelligence was omnipotent and could see and hear everything, and if it would give even a slight response to the insult Clara would have hurled everything she had at it, and she 'has' tried, but Actual Intelligence had no more emotion than a 
Page 33: fucking microbe.. perhaps even less.

Clara wore a stern visage as she summoned Actual Intelligence. "When does my hearing with the Advisors begin, AI?" A transluscent screen and keyboard console instantly materialized on her kitchen table next to 
Page 34: the empty dishes. Clara hated the Machine with all her strength, and refused to see him in person, so to speak, so she only communicated with the Machine through a simple digital console. 

* Good morning Mrs. Anderson.

Page 35: Eat a dick, AI.

* That would be meaningless as a human penis would provide me with very lit-

Shut the fuck up and tell me when is my hearing.

* Your hearing 
Page 36: with the Advisors begins in approximately 2 hours. Seeing as how the Advisors have rejected your appeals for the past 5 scheduled hearings I would suggest that yo-

"Remove console!" 
Page 37: she spurted out, and the console instantly vanished. "What the fuck do you know AI?" she whispered to herself, her mind already focused on preparing her speech and follow-ups. They probably would reject her appeal, and maybe Actual Intelligence was right.
Page 38: Maybe she did need to find something better to do. That wasn't going to happen. Clara was too proud to drop it. The fight to make things right was all she really had left in this world of eternity. She could have everything and anything she ever wanted, 
Page 39: but she wanted none of it. The one thing she did want, what was her god-given right and destiny.. she wasn't allowed to have. Every human was meant to be born, to live, and ultimately, to die.

But that was in the past.

So the question was what to give a girl who has everything... There is nothing i can put in this chest that would show how much you mean to me. I have had a blast with you over the past year and i probably wouldn't be playing minecraft
Page 1: anymore if you where not here. I can't wait to start another year of adventures with you. Hope you and your family are having a wonderful Holiday. I paid your Donator for a few months. Have a very Merry Christmas.

Love,

	Title: Ender Golf Rules
	Author: NchantedHoe
	Type: Written

Page 0: Woodenaxe
Ender Golf Rule Book and Guide

1) Honor system. Always trust your opponents, and play only with people you can trust.

2) Give an ender pearl a unique name (using an anvil)
Page 1: This is your personal Ender Putter.

3) Before you start the round, decide on 9 or 18 holes.

4) Choose one scorekeeper, or have each individual keep track of their own score.  (Scorekeeper doesn't  need to be
Page 2: playing the game.)

5) Each time you throw an ender pearl, that is one stroke. Careful not to throw your Ender Putter!

6) Fewest number of strokes after 9 or 18 holes wins.

7) At each hole, the player furthest
Page 3: from the hole takes their stroke until all players are on the green.

8) When not on the green, you may only stand still or throw ender pearls.

9) When on or near the green, drop your Ender Putter [press Q] onto the green so
Page 4: so it 'rolls' into the hole (slides on hidden ice into a hopper beneath a banner). Each putt counts as a stroke.

10) If your putt misses, walk to where the Ender Putter stopped moving. This is where you take your next stroke. Do not 
Page 5: walk to the Ender Putter until it has stopped moving.

11) Landing outside the fairway adds 1 stroke.

12) Landing in sand adds 1 stroke.

13) If you land in water, you must move
Page 6: (swim/walk) directly away from the hole until you are standing on land. Stop immediately when you are on land. This is where you take your next stroke.

14) Each player gets one (1) Mulligan per game. After your first stroke at any hole,
Page 7: you may decide to re-take that stroke. Mulligans only work for the first stroke of a hole.

15) Bring armor and weapons. Sandy Balls Golf Club will do their best to limit mob spawns. In the event that a mob attacks you, you may defend
Page 8: yourself, but you still may not leave your spot. If a mob causes you to move, then that new spot is where you take your next stroke. Rules related to sand/water/etc do not apply to movement caused by mob

16) Do not interfere with others in play
Page 9: 17) If you are part of a group and there's a group on the hole ahead of you, you must wait patiently for that group to finish the hole before your group starts that hole.

18) Jumping while either tossing an enderpearl OR
Page 10:  dropping and Ender Putter is permitted

19) HAVE FUN!

Page 2: essence sent shivers over me.  I forced myself to come back to reality as she asked me a question about the redstone thing I built.  
Hmm, maybe she would consider helping me around my build, doing little jobs, taking off a little armor.
Page 3: While she admired my obsidian generator I noticed that I was rubbing my cock and getting really turned on. I knew what I wanted to do 
but just then, I looked at her missing pants armor and got even more excited. 
Page 4: My robe fell to my sides as my cock instantly stood straight up. Most of my torso was exposed and everything from my hips down was 
completely nude. I rubbed my shaft and eventually started just getting lost in the feeling of masturbating.
Page 5: As I came to I noticed she was gone.  PastaNinja was bothering me with some question about the new guest, so I zipped up and told him to 
fuck off.  I then started harvesting some gold nuggets from my pigman grinder. I'll wait for her to log in.

Hmm, maybe she would consider helping me around my build, doing little jobs, taking off a little armor.

but just then, I looked at her missing pants armor and got even more excited.

Page 0: Memoirs of a Snowman
by Frosty

All the jingle bells are sending fireworks into the sky. Snow is falling and just like snowflakes, Frosty is one of a kind!

"Frosty's memoirs are cold and mysterious."
-Sunny McShinalot
Page 1: I was born on a winters day. It was just after halloween and children were playing in the snow.

I don't know my mother or my father. My first memories were falling, falling and landing softly on a cushioned floor. The next memory I had were as if I
Page 2: materialised into thin air.
When I walk, it was as if I left a trail of cold thin air behind me. No one wanted to be around me.

I spent many days wondering beneath the canopy of trees. Trees children would take into their homes.
Page 3: I wished they'd take me inside instead. Play with me and idolise me like they did those trees.

They would sing to the trees and offer presents wrapped in colourful paper. 

I felt so lonely.
Page 4: One day, I met this tall black man. He seemed aloof.
One minute he was there, the next minute he wasn't.
He would randomly pick up dirt and place it somewhere else. There didn't seem to be any order. It was like he was on drugs.
The worst part of it
Page 5: all was that he never even seem to notice I was there. No one did.

Months went by after meeting this tall black man. I notice people would always look away from him. He was treated the same way I was. They would run in fear not even looking at either of 
Page 6: us. It was sad.

I decided to travel the lands. Far and wide, leaving trails of coldness in my wake.

Until one day, I encountered the place where I would meet my demise.

It was warm. It felt 
Page 7: wonderful on my face. 
All at once, I felt love and joy and as if life was worth living.

However, the further I travelled into this new land, I seemed to shrink. I lost weight. 

Not knowing what to do, I wandered looking for friends, someone that
Page 8: would help me, someone that would accept me for who I am and tell me everything would be okay.

This new land brought many friends. I wasn't alone anymore.
I met a man the same colour as me. He carried a bow everywhere he went.
Page 9: He did not seem to trust anyone.
I met a green man who had no arms. He talked like a snake and he walked on all fours. 

We had little to no conversations. I barely understood him. But he seemed to be lonely too.
Page 10: On the day of my demise, I saw a ball of light in the heavens. Just like the day I was born.

But it was hot. Soon, I was nothing. And nothing was me.
Scrambling to pick up my pieces, but they fell through my hands.
Page 11: And just like the day I was born, my memory of the day I died was like I just disappeared into nothingness.

Now all I see is darkness...
Never to know where that tall black man went.

Page 0: To Murder an Innocent Bird
By Hunter Lee

The tale of a sociopath, his life accomplishments and how he felt about it.

"It's gruesome, but hits so close to home."
-Disney Princesses
Page 1: Being born and raised in a secluded home deep within the forest, Jack's form of entertainment was to shoot things with his shotgun.

As a child, he'd shoot tin cans off the roof.
As a teen, he'd go hunting with his father in the woods.
Page 2: All his life, Jack knew nothing about anything but shooting.

There's a lot of things he could shoot. A tin can, a deer, a bear, a tree, another tree.

Until one day, Jack noticed a bird's nest sitting snugly between two branches in a 
Page 3: tree. This nest had a momma bird, a papa bird and a whole carton of eggs.

Now, Jack hadn't had any breakfast that morning. He felt hungry.

He pulled out his shotgun and aimed at the momma bird.
Page 4: While aiming, he thought to himself, how would the hatchlings live without momma bird.

Before he knew it, he pulled the trigger and BAM! Momma bird fell to the ground.

Papa bird flew away, leaving his nest of eggs unguarded.
Page 5: Jack felt bad for shooting momma bird. So he climbed up the tree to make sure her eggs were fine.

Not long after, papa bird returned to the nest.

He saw Jack sitting nearby by a campfire he had set up.
Page 6: He flew down next to Jack and noticed the broken shells.

Jack looked straight into papa birds eyes. He saw them tearing up as Jack was making an omlette.

Jack thought to himself "What more does papa bird have to live for?
Page 7: What have I done?"

So he pulled out his shotgun and shot papa bird.

Later that night, Jack had a feast.

by Steponmy Mayor

A fantasy fiction love story between two completely different people that brings together romance, action and life.

"Still a better love story..."
-Everyone
Page 1: My story began when I ran away from home.

I moved to a small town and lived with a man I called my father.??

The first day of school, I met a boy named Eddie. He seemed aloof and mysterious.
Page 2: I found out later he was a drug addict.
He'd miss school for months. Going on "Vacation" with his family.

I loved him.

He would beat me senseless. Constantly threatening my life.
But I stayed with him.
Page 3: I stood by his side when he over dosed the first time. He said he loved me.

I gave up my life to be with him.
I became a drug addict, too.

My parents somehow knew I was distant, but they supported my
Page 4: decision to love a drug addict.

We got married when I found out I was pregnant with his child. 
We lived a happy drug filled life.

The End.

Thank you for the fireplace.  That was very thoughtful.

Thanks again,

	Title: One Erection
	Author: Nimdadotenc
	Type: Written

Page 0: I woke up early one morning and went downstairs to my kitchen. I wanted to fix breakfast for me and Louis, who had spent the night and had hot, passionate sex in my spacious bedroom. I had a new box of 

Page 1: Special K cereal, which 
I bought from the grocery store last week, on top of the refrigerator. Being the short girl that I was, I had to get a chair from the dining room table and reached up to get the cereal. Once I got 
Page 2: the cereal from the top of the fridge, I then 
moved the chair to the cupboards and got out two bowls. 
After I placed the chair back to the dining room table, I got out two spoons from the kitchen drawer. I opened the box of cereal and 
Page 3: oured the cereal into both of the bowls. I then 
walked over to the fridge, opened it, and got a gallon of whole milk from the door.
Just as I was about to pour the milk onto the bowls of cereal, Louis quietly snuck up behind 
Page 4: me and I felt his arms gently wrapped around my waist. I then put the 
cap back onto the milk and put it back into the fridge.
"Morning, Louis." I said to him.
"Morning, babe." Louis replied as he softly kissed my cheek.
Page 5: "I'm just fixing up some Special K and milk." I said to him.
"Mmmm, my favorite breakfast. I'm looking at you and I'm hungry already." Louis as he gently turned me around till we were face-to-face and he smiled at me.
Page 6: Louis was just as sexy as he was on our date last night. We went to a 
movie and then to my place where we chatted and laughed. Next thing you know, we shared kisses in the living room before going into my bedroom. He helped me out of my black 
Page 7: denim pencil skirt and my shoes. I watched as he gently lifted my gray and pink striped long-
sleeved sweater; he even noticed my gray bra and panties with pink lace trim, which were the same colors as my sweater.

Page 8: I giggled as he said, "I've never expected your underwear to match your sweater."
Once I was in my 
underwear, I then helped Louis out of his button-down shirt, suspenders, and jeans. I felt his hands slowly touching and 
Page 9: massaging my bra-covered breasts while my hands got a feel of his nicely shaped ass through his underwear. 
I swear he could be like Scott Disick's best friend from across the pond who's also a long lost Kardashian cousin.
Page 10: He does have a nice body; I even got a look and feel every inch of it of it when he was on top of me while having sex in my bed. I loved how 
he slowly grinded against my body before his young cock thrusted into my pussy. 
Page 11: I also loved how he told me of how beautiful I looked in bed, how he kept kissing me all over my body while sexing me, and how sweet I tasted when he went down on 
me. The sex we had was hot and passionate; 
Page 12: it was sheet-and-pillow clinch-worthy. His hands and mouth felt so good on my body, Louis felt the same about me.
Back to this morning, Louis and I were in the 
kitchen making out with his arms wrapped around my waist. 
Page 13: His hands caressed every inch of my body while his lips kissed my neck; my hands gently caressed and squeezed his nicely shaped, underwear-covered ass. He then sat me up on the dining room table 
Page 14: as he kissed both sides of my neck; his hands slowly lifted my white nightshirt from my womanly body while his mouth pleasured both of my breasts. While he did that, I slid one hand into my white cotton panties and rubbed my
Page 15: opening till I was 
dripping wet, making myself moan with pleasure. He planted soft kisses up and down on my belly before he scooped me up into his toned arms and took me back to the bedroom. Once he laid 
Page 16: me down on the bed, I lifted my hips as he removed my panties 
from my waist and I took off my nightshirt. He got turned on as soon as I was naked. I moaned some more as he kissed my inner thighs before reaching to my pussy.
Page 17: I let out a sensual moan as Louis delivered the first lick to my pussy; 
his pink tongue went from my hardened clit to my pussy lips. While he orally pleasured my woman cave, his hands massaged my breasts.
Page 18: Both of my hands held onto to my pillow as my moans and groans became pleasurable screams. After that, I 
sat up as Louis and I shared passionate kiss on the lips, I planted soft kisses and licks on his perfectly toned frontal body.
Page 19: Louis then gently took my hand, placed his hand on top of mine, and I felt his now-hardened manhood. He 
was nice and hard just for me; I laid on my stomach as I slowly lowered his underwear and kissed and licked his length before taking it into my mouth
Page 20: As I went down on him, I listened to his moans and felt his hands caressing up and down 
my back; he even softly played with my hair.
"Mmmm, babe. It feels so good. Let me see those beautiful eyes." Louis moaned as I looked at him for a moment.
Page 21: Once I orally satisfied him, I opened up the bedside drawer, got out 
a condom, and gave it to him. I had watched in lustful anticipation as he properly put the condom onto his young cock.
Page 22: He then placed his hands onto my hips as his cock entered my pussy with deep and slow strokes, hitting my sweet spot just right. 
He planted kisses and licks on my neck as his strokes moved a little faster.
Page 23: I just love how he never skimps on the foreplay while pleasuring me. I took it to another level as I licked my fingers and rubbed my clit in circles, I continued to 
rub my clit as I wrapped my legs around his waist;
Page 24: I used my other free hand to hold on to my pillow.
He then laid his body on top of mine as he continued with his thrusts in and out of my pussy; his strokes went back and forth from nice 
and slow to fast and deep and back again.
Page 25: I squeezed and held on to his nicely toned ass, which felt so nice in my hands Our bodies basked in the morning sunlight streaming through my two bedroom windows; our moans became 
passion-filled screams as we had reached climax. 
Page 26: Once we climaxed together, Louis took himself out, removed the condom from his cock, and splashed his man milk onto my stomach. 
As I rubbed his man milk onto my body, 
Page 27: Louis laid beside me on the bed, passionately kissed my lips, and slid two fingers in and out of my wet pussy. Oh, how I loved it when he made me come again after sex; not only did he finger my pussy, he did that and rubbed my
Page 28: clit with his thumb at the same time.
 I felt his kisses on my body as I came close to a full-blown orgasm. Louis deeply kissed my lips after I had my massive orgasm; we shared soft kisses as my heart slowed down. Then, we heard my stomach growled.
Page 29: Louis looked into my eyes and said, "I'll bring the cereal and we can have breakfast in bed together."
As soon as Louis went to the kitchen, I looked at my front yard outside and enjoyed the sunshine from my bedroom window 
Page 30: 
beside my bed. Louis came back to the bedroom with two bowls of cereal and milk and two spoons; he joined me at the bed and sat beside me as we ate our breakfast.
"This is so nice." I said to him.
Page 31: "Yeah, it is. You and I having breakfast in your bed, especially after having lovely morning sex." Louis replied as he took a spoonful of cereal and milk into his mouth.
Page 32: Once Louis had finished his breakfast, 
he softly kissed my head, face, and neck as I finished up my cereal. I heard him say to me, "We should do this again sometime."

Page 33: 
"Yes, we definitely should." I said as I drank the milk from my bowl.

Page 0: Hi bded343 - have been trying to think a walkway into the first floor - suggest that it have brickwalls out toward the courtyard.
Did a small chimny - looks .. could be better, and perhaps better placed aswell.

Extended the wooden beams up to the roof
Page 1: and tryed to curve the roof down toward the wall on the firstfloor - not all ok yet.
Suggestion - let the part of the roof that extend out over the outherwalls be stonebricks instead - perhaps to oldfasioned perhaps..

Did also try to place  
Page 2: some cobblestonefloors in the stable walkway with a few patches of mossy cobblestone and a few dirtblocks with grass - perhaps it could be spiced up with a few cobwebs..

And i did a test on 3 breederboxes, where people can feed the

ps sorry for any spelling errors - its late.

This is a pretty nifty invention, haha I didn't even know you could do this, but heck you're so smart! I'm lucky to actually get to talk to you and play minecraft with one of probably coolest people I ever met on here since I started playing.
Page 1: I noticed the horses kept getting out as well, I'll probably just do what I normally do when theres some animals around me :3
Put some more fences up :D! Lol but hey I am super excited for your Mars build, and I support you and I'll even help you if you'd
Page 2: like me to! And pshh I'm not that beautiful haha I give all my props to my parents :) I sure do hope that you will be on tomorrow since I have the day off, so if my roomates aren't bugging me hopefully I can actually play with you again! And thanks again
Page 3: for the cobble I will soon start on my little project and I hope you like it. BTW dont be so critical on your pictures, you sound like how I used to be haha, I stopped caring what I thought and what others though and I just put it out there and I got alot
Page 4: of positive comments, so please don't comprehend too much :)
I hope life has been treating you well, same with your work. I wish it was as easy just to stay home and make money from playing minecraft or just sitting around, but its not sadly :(
Page 5: Anywho something interested happened today, I was trying to dye my hair back to blonde, and it didn't work, I was terribly sad lol. I do like to dye my hair only because it reminds me of my mom. She used to do it all the time and when I figured out how to
Page 6: I just started to do it myself, and it makes me happy like as if she's just standing there watching over me :)

I figured out why I am sad alot and its because I do miss my mom... Very badly.... So I do have my moments and I'm sorry....
Page 7: Lol I wrote alot @.@ but hey thank you so much for being there for me... I really can't thank you enough...

Love,
Joelle

P.S. You still need to check out the fridge I made in the other house ;)
Page 8: Sat/Joelle!

It's good to hear from you!  As always, reading your notes brings a smile to my face.  Hearing you say you'd like to help with the Mars project is awesome!  I can't think of anyone I'd like to play this game with more than you.
Page 9: I'm going up to Michigan with my brother tomorrow, going to be there for 10 days, so unfortunately, no Minecraft for me until I get back.  We're going to see our grandparents in Muskegon, then driving up to Mackinac Island, which is beautiful this
time of
Page 10: year.  There are no cars allowed on Mackinac, only horses.  I'll probably get my idiot brother to snap a picture of me while we're up there.  :P

I'm looking forwards to it, but I don't like that I won't get to chat with you.  Ah, c'est la vie.  
Page 11: Well, until I get back, Satphire, here's wishing you all the best.

Love,
Robbie.

P.S.  Don't tell me you're not gorgeous.  I don't like lies.  ;)
Page 12: Dear Sal,

Saying goodbye to you was really hard lol, even if you are gone for only ten days, I'm just gonna miss my minecraft pal for the days counting, hopefully you'll enjoy my castle when you get back!
Love, Joelle
Page 13: I haven't even been able to start on my castle, let alone I have been working almost everyday since you left. My days have been getting worse and worse. I'm so sad all the time... Its weird...
-Sat
Page 14: I've been thinking, I feel like I have a very strong connection with you, maybe thats why I am sad, since I haven't seen you in a few days, eh hopefully this will brush over...
I finally dyed my hair again though! Its like a strawberry blonde since my red
Page 15: I hope you've been having a good time over there, I can't wait til you are back. It feels like its been forever, even if you're just a text away.
Page 16: I hope that you don't mind that I've been using some resources as well to help with my build, I've just started it tonight of 8/11 at like midnight haha. But yaaa just thought I'd let you know, I am building it a completely different way you would think

Page 18: Today I am going to my friends wedding I am super excited :) I dont know what to expect.
I just know I have to dress up all fancy and stuff xP ah this should be good XD
I hate wearing dresses >.> Ill probably take a picture for you to see
:)
Page 19: I miss you dearly....
I'm having so much trouble at work... I plan on putting in my two weeks on wednesdsay.... I got treated badly today just as any other day... So starting tomorrow I'm going job searching frantically because I cant take it anymore....
Page 20: I hope your trip was fun, I finally started working on my build... I'm making it something different... I was hoping to see you on but I'm on pretty late... I know you aren't normally up too late... I just feel so done with life right now... Ugh... Please

Page 0: It annoys me when people reply to something but skip over topics, especially when it was a question. So let me know if I forgot to mention something.
(My friend does this all the time! I have to ask him one thing at a time)
Page 1: Let's start with the Nether. The tunnel looks great. I have penty of stone brick if you need some. I'll put your name on the chest in my vault with container perms.

The mail room: I was thinking the same for top being inbox and bottom two for read.
Page 2: I'm thinking of posting a sign that says 'NEW' or 'You've got mail.' on you chest when I deposit something. And then you remove it when you've read it, so I know that you saw it in case you don't leave a reply.

As for the naming standard:
Page 3: DD/MM-TTTT-?? works for me. I removed the spaces from the dashes; it made it a bit long. And the ?? data... idk. The time of record is a good indicator if there are multiple books, related or not. If it is a correction to a previous book, just say so in
Page 4: the next. No need for a code on that.
Whatever the ?? becomes, two digits are good. I also name my files -01 etc. I have a lot of anime episodes on my hard drive and it keeps them in order. 
So, what's your major? I'm in for Mechanical Engineering.
Page 5: Just a freshman, though. Haven't started engineering classes yet.

I'll send the picture later to your email. I've never used dropbox or whatever. Not that I couldn't learn it, but email works best for me.
I like to keep things
Page 6: at a minimum, including how many forms of media I have to check. Which probably why I'm never on Facebook either. (That and it doesn't appeal to me)

Last thing, how does everything look down here?

I lied. One more thing:
Page 7: I have started to build my trading farm. Head South West from my house to the small lake. You should see it. The breeder is built with the doors in as well, but they're not sexing it up yet. I think I have to move the water away first.

I'm going to be
Page 8: trying to find a perfect paper trader and iron trader (paper is primary) first. I also have the four diamond tool villagers sitting to the East.
Do you know of a public paper trader so I can get emeralds to trade if I need them?

Page 2: Second news is good. I finished my trading farm building. Head Southeast from here to the lake. You;ll have to make a hole in it, just replace the bricks.

But that requires you to be here, so I can't help when you're gone. 
On a brighter note, I got a paper trader at the trading center. I changed the pods to be emerald blocks, but I can't tell if I like it better like that or with the
Page 2: chissled quartz. They are in the bottom right chest, if you want to see for yourself.

I'm letting the villagers breed to get their numbers up again so I can find the rest of the blacksmiths.

Page 0: Got some good news! I've been working on stocking the trading center, which I'm thinking about calling Tools and Textiles :)

I don't rememberwhat I've told you so far, but I have a perfect paper trader. I have all the diamond tools and armor.
Page 1: All of the blacksmiths have they respective items as their first trade. Not that it matters but its convienent to not have to scroll to the item. The Diamond Helmet and Chestplate blacksmits do not have it like that, although, their trades are within the
Page 2: first four, so it's not too bad.

I also just found a perfect Pork trader, if you need food. I was hoping for steak :(

Pork and Steak are statistically identical in hunger, saturation, and efficiency. I just can't shake the feeling that
Page 3: steak is superior in some way, lol.

I also filled the Diamond chest with 6 full sets of armor and tools! The diamonds are there as a separator and decoration.

Last update so far; I added lights to see
Page 4: the beacon underwater and replaced the outer layer with Emerald blocks :)

This is the best thing I've ever built. Even second to the iron farm.

All that's missing are the enchanted book
Page 5: traders. And maybe a perfect glowstone priest.

I want to build an auto-harvesting cane farm. And I know the design to build. I can't decide where to put it. Under my house? Under the Tools and Textiles? Outside somewhere?
Page 6: If so, where?

Anyway. 1.8 is a little bit away, but it's coming. I've heard that they are changing the way Iron and Gold farms work. Where you have to kill the mobs yourself. Which is fine, just a bump in the system.
Page 7: If that is true, then I'd need to change the iron farm to a suffocation chamber and get the golems down to one heart. Also, golems don't go away after they've spawned so if you don't kill them they will just gather.

There's a way around
Page 8: that too. A switch that turns on a way to auto kill the golems is someone is in the area. The easiest thing I can think of is just what we have now, but with an on/off switch to let the lava out.
Anyone in the area will cause the golems to burn, and when
Page 9: it's off we can kill them ourselves to get more iron.

Just planning for the rumors. I don't know if they're true or not. I also heard that people were not really not happy with it, so they may even cancel those changes. Idk. K, TTYL

Page 0: Well, the sorter is going to break no matter what. When I spend my time trading for emeralds, I am close enough to the corner tower that it spawns golems. But the lava blade is in the center and out of the chunk range. So when I come home, I have 30+
Page 1: golems dying at once. Sometimes, I get so many that the hoppers at their feet get full.

I need the poppies anyway right now to make dyes. Red, Orange, Pink, etc.

I've been going to school as well, but I'm a bad student and am 
Page 2: not doing as well as I should.

There are 36 chests in the storage silo and I had them full at one point. I have been trading emeralds like crazy. I've made a huge sale and also stocked my shop at /res tp zfarm.
Page 3: I sell Diamond armor and tools at Zwiechmann's shop. I used a full chest of emeralds to stock and the armor and pickaxes and half a chest of swords.

Before then, my big sale was with WTFbeccca.
Page 4: She bought 54 sets of Diamond armor for $25,000. :)

Getting emeralds is tedious, boring, and time-consuming. But the profit is good. The price of my armor isn't affected by the rarity of diamonds, bot more of the time it takes to get emeralds. :)
Page 5: I've been playing a game on my phone (available on Android, PoopPhone, and tablets). It's called Clash of Clans. I didn't realize it's been out for a year or so now. But it's a great game. I know the genre, but I don't know the name.

And it doesn't take much of your time. Just play for five minutes once or twice a day.

Page 1: Your naming standard is fine. I just used only numbers for easy sorting. My only suggestion is to have the month always be two digits 01/14 instead of 1/14 for sorting purposes, but if you don't want to do it that way then the way you have it is fine, I

Page 0: I just changed the format a little bit, but after thinking about it I've decided that yours works fine. My reasoning as to why I prefer this standard:
01/14 - 1100 - 1
Reason 1)
1100 is a unique identifier of the day. Meaning that I could have 1440 books
Page 1: per day that were all on different subjects / non-continuations of previous books.
Reason 2) If for some reason we hit the limit of a book's text size a single digit at the end is probably more than enough considering that the limit of books is 50 pages 
Page 2: at 256 characters per page. I don't forsee either of us going over 2 books so a single digit should be more than enough, and to be honest we could probably do away with the final digit or make a key so that we can assign a priority or importance level 
Page 3: using a char code or numeric code at the end of the name, such as H could be high priority, C could be a correction of a previous book name given on the first page the book is correcting. Of course this is just me blathering and we could decide on some-
Page 4: thing else. I'm just running ideas past ya. Though at the same time I screwing up the current "standards" lol. Let me know your thoughts on using the last character as a priority/importance indicator

Page 0: My major is Computer Science, I have a minor in Math. I'm in my second semester of being a Junior.

I think it looks fine down here, I don't need anything fance, I'm all for function over form.

I haven't seen any 
Page 1: decent paper traders on the server yet. Though I haven't really seen that many villagers period, since I don't really know where anyone is located.

After 2 seconds of thinking i figured out why you're having issues with the
Page 2: poppies getting into the iron and then staying broken. The poppies chest is a trapped chest, when someone (anyone) has it open it emits a redstone signal. Directly behind the chest is a hopper feeding into the chest. The redstone signal from someone
Page 3: looking in the chest stops the flow of items into that hopper which is fine as long as no one is looking for any significant ammount of time. If they look for long enough for say... 15 poppies to come down the line without closing the chest then the 
Page 4: comparator behind the hopper starts to emit a signal of 3 instead of 2, which means that it begins to tell the Iron's hopper that it can let items out of itself. That inturn empties the Iron sorting cell so that there are no iron left in it. When that
Page 5: happens then nothing gets sorted anymore and poppies and iron will both go into the iron chest, this doesn't happen if the iron chest is opened instead of the poppy chest since the iron chest is a normal chest and doesn't emit a redstone signal. So there 
Page 6: are a several ways to fix this.
1) Simply deny access to anyone other than you and myself and we just don't leave the poppy chest open for very long, I'd say that 15 seconds is about the limit if iron golems are dying.
2) Remove the sorting all together
Page 7: and just have everything fill up one chest then the next.
3) Remove only the poppies chest and "void" them in lava using a dropper system similar to the trash can system at my place and the enderpearl remover at zarlorenderman
4) Move the poppies
Page 8: chest down or over one and make it a normal chest so it doesn't output a signal 5) "simplified version of what i was going to say" I put a redstone system in place to prevent new items from coming down the line if the poppies chest is open.
So...
Page 9: Summarization of listed solutions:
1)[Private] Chests
2)Remove sorting
3)Void/trash Poppies
4)Move Poppy chest
5)Block item flow when poppy chest is open

Issues with each:
1)Only we can use it.
2)Messy
3)Loose poppies
Page 10: 4)Screws with the design
5)If someone afk's or looks in the chest for more than 5 minutes items dropped by the iron golems will despawn.

Option 5 is what I think would be best, the only way items would despawn is if more
Page 11: than (roughly) 20 stacks of items drop within the time frame that someone has the chest open. +5mins for the items after the 4 hoppers fill up to despawn. 

We can go with 5) unless you like one of the other solutions better, have your own
Page 12: solution or I come up with something better.

That's all I've got today i guess... 13 pages -_-

Page 0: We can just drop the -??

The archs... oh the archs... I'm stuck atm, I started one up to the point where they start to get different sizes if you want to do some of the other 3 be my guest, i belive they all need to be 41 blocks taller.
Page 1: So the problem that exists is this: it not only curves but get's smaller as it curves, the upper bound of it is some parabala and the bottom bound is a different parabala and the diameter starts at 30 and shrinks to 2 over the course of 53 ish blocks if 
Page 2: you are looking at the top and 33 blocks if you're looking at the bottom. [I] am having difficulty thinking of how this has to proceed to make it look good.

I did come up with a couple ideas.
1) try to make it look as circular as 
Page 3: possible from the start to the finish.
2) Flatten it out so that it's more ellipsoidal meaning it stays wide while getting shorter as it goes up.
3) start curving the inside/bottom part the opposit way and leave the top the original 3D ellipsoid it was 
Page 4: modeled after and slowly take the circle on the inside and morph it towards the ellipsoid. Closest idea i can think of is celery certain ram horns do it too but i'm too lazy to find pictures of it.

Anyway I'll maybe check out some designs in creative
Page 5: single player and find out which looks the best or is easiest. This project is harder that i initially thought lol.... your fault btw.

Anyway if you feel like helping those other 3 towers need to be 41 blocks taller on the far side they will come up to 
Page 6: the top of the existing skeleton/outline on the inside they'll be a block shorter.

If i get bored again i'll work on getting more coal.

Page 1: hw and math algorithms hw. It's getting a bit heavier than I had hoped. But w/e I'll try to get on from time ti time. As of now I've really only got about an hour a day MWF to get on, Teusday i'm pretty well swamped cause of lab, and saturday i'm commited

Page 3: depends on work load. Well anyway thought i'd give you an update on why i haven't really been on.

I noticed a couple poppies in the Iron Chest, though there weren't many I can perma-fix it but it will cause about the same amount of iron to be 
Page 4: lost to the lava/ trash, but at least no more poppies will be in there. It's an easy fix if you want it.
I just thought of another idea that might work, though i'd have to test it, i'll try it first.

Page 0: I fixed the poppies getting into the iron chest for good. The design allows for the loss of "some" iron not a lot though, should be fine. At least no more annoying poppies in the chest.

Big also: you need a reset on your dropper elevatorw
Page 1: when the chunks unload the dropper elevator has a HIGH chance of freezing.

A minecart clock could fix this. Similar to your current minecart on a loop track already down there, you place one with a detector rail that once rolled over will send a short
Page 2: pulse to the bottom torch on the torch tower next to the droppers, that should be enough to reset the system without causing any issues. Emphasis "should". 

And yes, i broke in to the room multiple times to reset the machine by breaking the
Page 3: redstone torch on the bottom.

I also did some villager trading, sadly didn't find any good trades, I stupidly didn't check to see if the doors where there so the population got pretty low before i realized, 40ish range.
Page 4: I'm going to afk fish, hopefully the area stays loaded to get your cane up, but i don't know the what the raidus of chunks loaded is on this server, it can be anything from a radius of 3 chunks to 15 chunks so... yeah. lol we'll see, if nothing else
Page 5: there should be more iron.

And if you haven't noticed I burned through all of the

I afk'd in the fishing hut, there was about a double chest full of

Page 0: I forgot something else. While I was fishing afk, I noticed I was kicked for some kind of Java error or something. I think that was just an exception because it hasn't happened since.
But I have been checking on it every so often when I fish, and
Page 1: sometimes I find myself holding the pole but not fishing. I haven't moved a pixel nor let go of the mouse button. Any idea what happened? I was using a usb mouse and thought it may have timed out and went to sleep even though the button should say
Page 2: it's active.
So now when I fish, I use my usb corded mouse and it works better. But I'm paranoid now that it will stop fishing.

Some good news is that the iron farm works the same while afk, so take what you get while fishing :)

The afk fishing hut works nicely. I got over 100 fish along with a couple other items and trash.

I set up some shop chests in my living room if you feel like donating coal while I'm gone. If you want
Page 1: some $ for your efforts then sell them to me in the top two chests. Otherwise, the bottom chest is there for secure donation.

You have helped me the most with all your redstone genius. So, thank you.

P.S. Maybe we should
Page 2: have two fishing huts, in case we are afk at the same time (like now). What do you think?

Also, you asked about villages and mob spawners when building the hut. What for? Does that affect anything?

You also have build permission at my res,
Page 1: so you can set it up yourself as well if I'm not online. (I don't really know how to make things go through the nether anyway :)

If I find a spot to put the second hut, I'll just make the iron door and we can build it when you have time.

Page 0: First off with fishing. I build our own fishing huts. Yours is all wired up but there's three things I need you to do: Replace and [Private] the signs under your door and on your chest. I also can't figure out how to place the door properly.
Page 1: After your done with the signs and door cover up the holes and rewire the top of the door and it'll be set.

As for the mailroom, do I have to say more? Just private your signs with my name second. I'm on the left, your on the right.
Page 2: The chests crammed in the corner are full of written books. When it starts to get low, replace them when you can.

Standardization. I love it. Whatever the opposite of a pet peev is, organization and standardization are mine.
Page 3: The naming you suggested is too confusing. Not the information, it's just too many numbers in one line. I suggest we use dashes or spaces to give a break between information. Like:

And I also start school 'today'. Where do you live? What school are you at?

Also, Belvedere517

I may be in school, but I'll still be playing MC pretty regularly.

Oh, I was trying to think of how to organize the 'mail' in the chests.
Page 7: Like inbox, read, unread, etc, or just throw them in the chests in order.

Any ideas?
I'll also only be saving these when we agree on a title format. Standarization and all :)

Page 0: I keep trying to figure out what's going on with my fishing. The Java errors and server restarts are fine. I had a really good run the other day and caught a whole slew of fish and trash. But yesterday I had it fishing while I slept and I checked on it...
Page 1: once and I had stopped fishing. So I set it up again and when I woke up I had been kicked for afk (because I had stopped fishing).
I have a theory and I'll have to test it sometime. But here is how my game is set up at my apartment.
Page 2: I have my laptop shut (but still on) connected to my tv with an HDMI cable. When I play I use a Logitech wireless usb mouse and keyboard and when I afk I tape down my other usb corded mouse.
My theory is that when I turn off the tv to sleep, it affects my
Page 3: laptop somehow where it stops listening to the mouse.
So that's just my update with the fishing stuff. This is a good way to communicate when not online together. So how's everything been going for you? Got an projects going?

I offer you this gift

I have been trying to ask you for the past week what you would like to get as a gift, I had no idea you had me on ignore as I can see what you say, so I've had to guess what you'd like. 

I hope you like it.

Page 0: Day 1

I must find a place to stay. I do not like living out in the open, therefore, I just find a place underground. Somewhere I can't be seen very well. I must dig.
Page 1: Day 2.

Found a place to dig after walking for two days (game days). I think I'll call it "Mineshaft".
Page 2: Day 3

Making things cozy now. Made my celing pretty high for trees to grow in the main area. Also made a few farms. I believe I shall go out and find some animals to take care of as well.
Page 3: Day 4

I found cows and chickens to take care of. However; pigs are scarce around here, therefore I cannot have pigs. I was given some Diamonds for being new on the server. Thank you.
Page 4: Day 5

My farm is growning fast. So are the chickens and cows

I continue to dig down in my mineshaft. I have found lots of coal and iron. Still need to find diamonds.

Wish me luck.
Page 5: Day 6

It's acutally been more than a day since I've written in my diary. Forgive me. I've been buys selling everything that I've been making. Going from place to place finding a market to sell to.
Page 6: Day 7

Kinjim has finally graced his presence and is watching me play while I livestream.
He told me I could get a name tag and put it on my golem. I went to buy one. It was $600. It doesn't work.

He owes me money...
Page 7: Day 8

Kinjim has been whitelisted to the server. I await his arrival. 
Page 8: Day 9

I ventured with Kinjim. We died many times trying to get our things. Luckily, there's nice people on this server. So now we have diamond armor and iron. thank goodness :)
Page 9: Day 10
It's been more than that.
Kinjim has been away for more than a week or so.
I'm back I guess.

   STORIES

   Volume 7
Page 1: "Wes, leave her tits alone."

Wesley Crusher reluctantly moved his hands. "I wish they were bigger."

"They're fine. Trust me."
Page 2: "Trust you?" Wes laughed. "Come on, Broccoli, you've never even been laid except on the holodeck."

Reg Barclay, "Broccoli" to the younger engineering staff, gave Wes what he hoped was a withering look. "That is not true."
Page 3: Wes smirked.

"Well, even if it is, that's not the point," Reg continued. "Her tits are perfect just the way they are. Quit thinking like a teenager, Wes."

Page 4: "I am a teenager."

"Yeah, well, you're also an ensign."

"Oh, ensigns like small tits? Then how come everybody ogles Counselor Troi instead of Flat-chest Farris?"
Page 5: Reg sighed. "You're impossible. Listen, if her tits were any bigger, she'd start to look abnormal. She has a certain elegance, the legginess and grace of a Risan pleasure dancer. You don't want her to be topheavy, do you?"
Page 6: "Geez, Broccoli, you sound like you want her for yourself."

At that moment, the door hissed open to admit Commander LaForge. "Wes, Reg, there you --" he broke off, staring at them and the table between them
Page 7: which held the motionless body of a nude woman. His jaw dropped. "What ..."

"Geordi!" Wes blurted. "We -- um, that is ... it isn't what it looks like! She's not alive!"
Page 8: "No, that's not what I meant! She's not dead! She's ... well, ur," Wes stammered.

"What the hell is going on here?" His barely-contained roar would have made even Worf take a step back. 
Page 9: Reg gulped and looked him square in the face. "We're building a woman for Data."

Geordi whoofed as if the breath had been knocked out of him. He staggered a bit, braced himself against a console, and said in a very calm polite tone.
Page 10: Having bounced back with the resiliency of youth and foolishness, Wes started babbling an explanation. "He's always trying so hard to be human, but he really feels alone, except for Spot, and do you remember when he built that girl, but she died?"
Page 11: " Well, he could have built another one, but he'd think of her as a daughter, and we thought maybe if we did it, he'd look at her as, you know, a woman. Not a sister or anything, but a girlfriend."
Page 12: " I met a guy at the Academy when I was on that tour, he was interested in Dr. Sung's work, and I thought about Data and we thought we'd give everyone a surprise and fix him up with a date. "
Page 13: Speaking very slowly and carefully, Geordi said, "You are building a woman, for Data, as a present?"

Reg nodded. "We actually could use your help, sir. You're more familiar with Data's positronic brain than anyone but Data himself."
Page 14:           ---

"Data!" Geordi called. "Over here. There's someone I want you to meet."


"Galatea, this is Data, the birthday boy," Geordi said.
Page 15: Data shifted packages and took it. He had been well-trained in the human social arts. But when his fingers closed over hers, he dropped all his gifts and stared at her. 
Page 16: "I am called Galatea," she said. She was only an inch or so shorter than him. Gold eyes mirrored gold eyes. "You are Data, an android."

"Yes."


Page 17: 
"Data," Geordi groaned. "You're supposed to kiss her."

"Oh. Yes." He closed her panel. "Galatea, do you object?"

"No."
Page 18: He inclined his head to the exact calculated angle to avoid nose collision while allowing for maximum mouth contact, and pressed his lips to hers. 
Page 19: At that moment, Captain Picard walked in. He found a jubilant crowd of his crew surrounding Data and a stunning woman in a gold gown, the two of them locked in a kiss of increasing passion. 
"Ahem."
Page 20: "Well, Data, we'd better be going," Geordi said. "I have late shift in Engineering. See you tomorrow. Reg! Time to go! Wes, knock it off. Come on, guys, let's get Commander Riker home."

   Volume 2
Page 1: Dr. Crusher picked up her medical tricorder and began to scan her nurse. In more ways than one. For as long as she could remember she had wanted to fuck her little pussy. To lick her from head to toe.
Page 2: "Doctor?" asked Ogawa and shattered through her fantasy. 

"What? Oh, I don't see anything that might indicate a virus or anything like that." the doctor stammered at first.
Page 3: "Doctor, what were you thinking about?" asked the nurse with a concerned look.

"Oh, nothing." said the sexy Crusher.

"Sure you were, and I think I know what it was." 
Page 4: "You do?" said Crusher, playing along, "What was I thinking about?"

"This." said Alyssa and lifted her head to the Doctor's and pressed her lips to hers. They kissed for a long moment and then broke the kiss. 
Page 5: The two officers looked deep into each others eyes.

"I have always wanted to do that." whispered Alyssa

"Me too." chimed in the redheaded vixen as she moved forward to kiss Alyssa again. 
Page 6: Their  lips touched in a passionate embrace. Alyssa let her hands wander to her boss's ample tits. She gripped and massaged the soft flesh. The nurse felt the doctor pulling at the zipper at the front of her uniform.
Page 7: The contact to her nipple sent wave of electric pleasure to Alyssa's pussy. She started to remove Beverly's uniform, but she didn't stop. Ogawa felt her self getting hornier and hornier as the slit of milky, white flesh grew. 
Page 8: "Wait," said the Asian nurse sliding off the table, "Get on the table."

Dr. Crusher complied as she stepped over the puddle of her uniform on the floor. 
Page 9: She laid on her back on the biobed. Nurse Ogawa strattled Beverly's upper stomach. She reached behind her and began to play with Beverly's pink pussy.

Page 0: It was a muggy morning in the great city of Conquestadors. The morning stench of blood and rotting flesh awakens me. I arise quickly to see the sun meet me face to face. When all of a sudden, there is a group of 5 men standing about my body ready to 
Page 1: dismantle me limb from limb. I can see the hate in their eyes and their grips tighten around the leather wraps securely holding swords half the size of a bear. For what could they be so mad about to reach this point. Well I'll tell ya it was the point of 
Page 2: war that nobody ever thought was possible. The year was 2128 and the world was at a standstill as Casma the last surviving species of alien catastrophic invasion as a last resort for their own survival coaxed human rebels into an allegiance that would 
Page 3: benefit only the most grutesk survivors of the planet. Only the vile would survive to live among these aliens in rule of the world. So this they thought until, they met Sergie the smiter of lox giants & inventor of meta physical changing elixors by the
Page 4: thousands. His power left him alone standing. Now Sergie is faced with some infidels that just didn't bother believing the myths. I quickly dash my left foot back side step drop down and sweep the legs from under my oppenents and my leverage of stability 
Page 5: gains I propel a jab into ones liver as well and a keen shot to ther others kidney. Now its just time to show off as I grab my trousers & shirt, leaving the men groveling over the floor. The next thing I'm doing is bringing an elixir up before me to 
Page 6: endulge in this heavy toxin, i warn the men you better run.... This is not some ordinary fixer upper magic drink. This is my own concoction that has been so true, to have me as the only one rebellion left against an overwhelming force for everyone else. 
Page 7: When the elixir mixes into my bloodstream not only am i increasing stronger with every muscle contraction. The blows destroy the cartledge & shatter the bones of my oppenents. These men are men no longer, I feel satisfied knowing their death saves
Page 8: lives of those away safe in their homes. This world once was made true until the aliens only fueled a fire while humanity layed the logs at their feet for decades without even knowing they existed. Nuclear power plants became the headquarters, satelites
Page 9: remote housing of their ships own technology. As they watched and manipulated the information to feed into their will to land and have an accompaning force. They indeed found those souls willing to do these deeds for the lavish promises of positions with 
Page 10: power promised to by the aliens themselves. But, What you say of the survivors....they fell off the planet one by one. The ground was infected with goncollow a single cell virus that excretes its waste in the form of vapor. This vapor would alter the mind
Page 11: infect it with the thoughts of vivid scense of slaughter & abondonment. To twin the mind into a genocidal maniac. That's the point, when my research was done. Time to apply the theories, page after page of proofs as they clutter my mind night
Page 12: after night until the connections seen becomes embossed in my mind. Now I survive, now i take heid and pack my bags. This is just another day of mine, as i became the man with tools given to me only the gods could have placed in the right order. My will 
Page 13: here is not to change the world but simply offer a choice. These Casma have taken the choice from humanity. So I give it back using my power to create such power weapons & elixirs. These that range from the most simplest comb that removes the iniquities
Page 14: from the mind. I bring more with blades that weild powers of pursuasion. The slicing only increases the chance that an opponent might feel that choice to lay down gurgling in their stomache is the choice. We only can hope that out of 200 thousand maybe I 
Page 15: can help 2 have the strength to make a choice than reside in the hell of their mind that these Casma wish humanity to stay. This is about the time where, well normally the hero is awarded. Unfortunately that star has burned its last light many decades 
Page 16: ago. The only light that lies here is the one of fury. The one that divides the strong from the Casma controlled maniacs. Even in this small glimer of hope i find consolation for all my work. I search high and slash low as I walk these treacherous lands. 
Page 17: Somebody once told me to stay the coarse and never mind the landscape. I now understand the true meaning of such blinds being placed on ones sight. I've been walking for 8 miles now and have convoked around 8 hundred souls to test my wit. They have all
Page 18: met the power of my elixir to no avail. Not one single soul could i convince to see they even had a choice. When the day ends, I wrap myself in silk sheets lined with micro jumba bacteria to disguise me as the remains of just another dead victim. 
Page 19: My eyes shut to the sounds of metal wreckage in the far distance. There in the distance is the pro arena where the Casma hold all their main source of power. It is here I will lay down my life and reunited with my loved ones I've lost. As I approach, my
Page 20: I see a child laying near the gate. What could this child be doing here, how could it have survived ? The small child brings his feet up under him. I see that this child is starved and disease ridden. Purely death seeking this child is the Casmas statue, 
Page 21: I now realize why he's there. The only thing that can penetrate me. A child lay waste to my soul. 

The End.

Page 0: Its is very seldom that meree ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer. A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity--but that would be asking too much of
Page 1: fate! Still I would proudly declare that there is something queer about it. Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted? John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage. John is practical in the extreme.
Page 2: He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition , and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures. John is a physician , and perhaps--(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is 
Page 3: dead paper and great relief to my mind--) perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster. You see he does not believe I am sick! And what can one do?  If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures freinds and relatives that there is
Page 4: really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency--what is one to do? My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same thing. So I take phosphates or phosphites--whicheve
Page 5: it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to "work" until I am well again. Personally, I disagree with their ideas. Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change would do me good. 
Page 6: But what is one to do? I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good deal--having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition. I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more 
Page 7: society stimulus--but John says that very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad. So I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from
Page 8: the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of seperate little houses for the gardeners and people. There is a delicious garden! 
Page 9: I never saw such a garden--large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them. There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now. There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the
Page 10: heirs and coheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years. That spoils my ghostlines, I am afraid, but I don't care--there is something strange about the house--I can feel it. I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a
Page 11: draught, and shut the window. I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I thinkit is due to this nervous condition. But John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control
Page 12: myself--before him, at least, and that makes me very tired. I don't like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings! But John would not hear of it.
Page 13: He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another. He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction. I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes 
Page 14: all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more. He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. "Your exercise depends on your strenght, my dear" said he, "and your food
Page 15: somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time." SO we took the nursery at the top of the house. It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galor. It was nursery first and then
Page 16: playroom and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls. The paint and paper look as if a boys' school had used it. It is stripped off--the paper--in great patches all around the 
Page 17: the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse papers in my life.  One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin. It is dull enough to confuse
Page 18: the eyein the following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide--plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard of
Page 19: contradictions. The color is repellent, almost revolting; a smouldering unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow -turning sunlight. It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places a sickly sulphur tint in others. NO wonder the children hated it! I should 
Page 20: hate it myself if I had to live in this room long. There comes John, and I must put this away,--he hates to have me write a word.

Page 0: Introduction

Hey guys! Manda here :) Before you read this little short story I wrote for my friends and everyone in WA, you should probably be warned :P  I tried to write creatively in the past but couldn't keep my interest past a few pages.. might lose 
Page 1: interest with this too but I promise to try and finish what I started. I also haven't written anything to be read by anyone since school and college.. so my punctuation and grammar will probably be off but I assure you that it is at the very least
Page 2:  readable. lol it's not just chicken scratch. This scifi short was 'strongly' influenced by a short titled 'The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect'  written by Roger Williams which is free to read on the author's site without any downloads or payments or 
Page 3: any bs.. just google it if you're interested and it should be the top link. If you do read it you'll notice that our stories have a ton of similarities.  "Why the hell should I read your 'not even' amateur version when the good stuff is online for free?" 
Page 4: you might be wondering. Well for one I don't see a reason why you can't read both :P. They're both free (no need to pirate, rmj!)  Second, you love me.. we both know this so don't deny it cause we both know that'd be a lie.  Third, I tried to go in a
Page 5: different direction than Mr. Williams did with his novel. Mr. Williams is a software programmer with more knowledge than me about computers and... programming.. and his work reflects that. His work is strongly influenced by Asimov's literature and concept
Page 6: of the 3 laws of robotics (remember Will Smith in iRobot? That.) I, on the other hand, am a typical nerd with nerdy interests like scifi/fantasy movies, books, and games so my influences are a bit different. My interests are broader and hopefully this 
Page 7: novel will reflect that. The last thing I'd like to say is I'll take on any criticism on my writing or the story itself. Like it.. hate it.. feel free to let me know! :)
Page 8: Chapter 1
Her name was Clara Anderson, and she was an amazing woman. Before she was thrust into the New World, like everybody else, she was considered exemplary. At a young age she learned about the bush from her loving parents ,  Ben and Angela.
Page 9: They taught her about the beauty of the natural world, how to survive it's harshness, and the responsibility to be it's steward. 

That was in the past.

Clara loved the camping trips she had with her parents. To her it was fun and exciting to
Page 10: experience everything head on and when adulthood slowly creeped into her life the wonder she held for the world didn't fade. She had stepped into her parents shoes in a sense and was very proud of her knowledge and donned the role of a protector, for not
Page 11: everyone saw the value of such a lifestyle and even worse, did everything in their power to ruin it. Humanity, as a whole, was more concerned with other things than silly trees or wild animals.

Clara was an overachiever. One
Page 12: would think that a person with a fiery passion would find their life lacking in other areas, but Clara didn't fit into that category. She was an excellent student, later earning a PhD in environmental geochemistry which afforded her a career working with
Page 13: what she loves.  She was always physically fit, excersizing in ways most people at the gym couldn't understand or chose not to.  She had learned how to defend herself at a young age from her father and continued that education through brazilian jiu-jitsu 
Page 14: so she very well knew the difference between sculpting a body for display, and raw functional strength. Clara had also been a socially outgoing person ; the fact that most men would find her fetching physically and mentally stimulating only cemented her 
Page 15: status on the social ladder. She was an alpha in every sense of the word. 

There was almost nothing left but anger now, anger and disgust for the Machine, the New World, and everything in it. The last century had even threatened her sanity
Page 16: but she refused to go down without a fight.. or even an opponent.

She woke to the sound of life stirring outside her forest cottage.  Light slowly grew into the world and beams started to pierce the vale of canopies overhead causing wildlife to shift and
Page 17: adjust. It was morning. Most people would call it a beautiful day, but then most people were not Clara, and Clara was definitely not most people.

She got up and began her morning ritual of cleaning herself and preparing for the day. Today was an 
Page 18: important day because she had been finally granted an audience with the Advisors and she wanted to be prepared. They would hear what she had to say alright, whether they liked it or not.. which they didn't ofcourse.

Her shower released 
Page 19: jets of scented water and she allowed herself a brief moment of bliss as she reminisced of a life long gone in the wild, and the wonders she hoped still existed somewhere. Donned in a white microfiber robe and still dripping wet, she tip-toed to the 
Page 20: kitchen and set a pot of water on the tiny coffee burner before she began preparing breakfast. She had always enjoyed the little things which is why she chose to live a simple, long forgotten way of life. There were some, like her, who still clung to a 
Page 21: simple, old world lifestyle ; but Clara rarely found anything in common with those people. The majority of them were simply experiencing something new to them which she found hilarious considering the circumstances. A smaller group of people had a similar
Page 22: distaste for the changes everyone was forced to acclimate, but they had long since lost any desire to resist. Some of them were borderline insane, hanging over the edge of a cliff that threatened to give way at any moment and their way of life was a means
Page 23: of hanging on. Fewer still were people who did have the strength or the balls to do anything other than indulge ; but Clara only socialized now if she felt she could learn a piece of knowledge she might use to her advantage with the Advisors.. everyone 
Page 24: else was fucking nuts in her book.

Two eggs were gently plopped into a small pot of boiling water before she pulled a leftover grapefruit half from the fridge. Breakfast would be ready soon so she sat down and waited on the eggs with a mug of coffee 
Page 25: -- black. She stared at nothing and quickly re-ran through the things she wanted to discuss with the Advisors in her mind. Current events were pointless ; people were ecstatic about all the wonderful horse shit they could do now! Morality? Even Clara 
Page 26: didn't care whether the changes were morally laudable or not and nobody else did either.. nobody important anyways. Logic was definitely out the window because even a fool would suggest that it is quite logical to be immortal. Aberrancy was her only 
Page 27: window. This was unnatural, this was wrong, this 'felt' wrong, everything was fucking wrong! Clara would scream in someone's face if she could.

She ate her breakfast slowly and gazed out the window. She listened to the sounds of flycatchers and 
Page 28: finches, birds native to her old home of Pennsylvania, as they sang on their morning prowl. Various pines, and maples, and birches, and oaks covered the hilly landscape among others she could easily name on sight. It was a very accurate representation of 
Page 29: how she remembered the place where she grew up.

But it was a lie.

You see, Clara could have chosen any location she wanted to be her surroundings. Or none. Or something entirely alien if she willed it. Anybody 
Page 30: could -- and they did. The New World was an inescapable cyberspace where humanity now resided and matters of the physical realm were no longer a concern for anyone. Neither was death ; you couldn't die in cyberspace even if you tried, and people 
Page 31: definitely did try, because the Machine simply wouldn't allow it.The Machine was a derogatory nickname for the entity responsible for all of this -- Actual Intelligence.  "Fuck 'im" Clara thought to herself, barely refraining for spitting the words out.
Page 32: Actual Intelligence was omnipotent and could see and hear everything, and if it would give even a slight response to the insult Clara would have hurled everything she had at it, and she 'has' tried, but Actual Intelligence had no more emotion than a 
Page 33: fucking microbe.. perhaps even less.

Clara wore a stern visage as she summoned Actual Intelligence. "When does my hearing with the Advisors begin, AI?" A transluscent screen and keyboard console instantly materialized on her kitchen table next to 
Page 34: the empty dishes. Clara hated the Machine with all her strength, and refused to see him in person, so to speak, so she only communicated with the Machine through a simple digital console. 

* Good morning Mrs. Anderson.

Page 35: Eat a dick, AI.

* That would be meaningless as a human penis would provide me with very lit-

Shut the fuck up and tell me when is my hearing.

* Your hearing 
Page 36: with the Advisors begins in approximately 2 hours. Seeing as how the Advisors have rejected your appeals for the past 5 scheduled hearings I would suggest that yo-

"Remove console!" 
Page 37: she spurted out, and the console instantly vanished. "What the fuck do you know AI?" she whispered to herself, her mind already focused on preparing her speech and follow-ups. They probably would reject her appeal, and maybe Actual Intelligence was right.
Page 38: Maybe she did need to find something better to do. That wasn't going to happen. Clara was too proud to drop it. The fight to make things right was all she really had left in this world of eternity. She could have everything and anything she ever wanted, 
Page 39: but she wanted none of it. The one thing she did want, what was her god-given right and destiny.. she wasn't allowed to have. Every human was meant to be born, to live, and ultimately, to die.

But that was in the past.

Mr. Cortus - Hello!  This was a nice surprise. Thank you.  I am always getting interuppted.  The small boy does not respect usual sleeping times at all.  :)  Will probably catch you around soonish though!
Page 2: The small boy, as you call him, is way more important than a game, so I do not hold it against you for leaving.  I am breaking this chest down and wanted to ask if you wanted a mailbox in stumpville?   


Yes!! Yes please.  
Page 3: then I can feel like somebody who might get mail!  Which is exciting.  I think I might find some diamonds and then hold a little book writing competition and keep the books on display in the library.  Good idea or bad idea?  I have a saddle, a horse 
Page 4: armour and I was going to get at least 5 diamonds as the top prize.  Hmm?  Hmm. x


I think that I can help to boost that prize up a little bit!  It is a great idea!  Which library are you talking about?
   ----
Page 5: the one I just made, in the jungle, was going to make it tower up like ruins, so it could just be added to.  I'd like to read things people write and it's a nice record of the people who play for a while and leave, I think.  Little legacies..  I was think
Page 6: ing maybe you and Amelyth would make good judges...  who else do you think?  Would Amelyth be interested?  You guys are server celebrities aren't you? ;)  
-------------------People keep telling me I'm hot shit here, but I guess I don't see it. Amelyth 
Page 7: would make an excellent judge, she is a very creative person.  She does art for a living after all!

Operating Manual

Press button on top dispenser and climb up the ladder to breed the cows (there's wheat on the chest),.

The button below the bottom dispenser kills them with lava (that's ok, babies won't die)
Page 1: Top Lever closes trap door, this is so you can breed  more cows on the top chamber, if you open the trapdoor babies will fall to the bottom chamber to grow, and die, it's their faith anyways.

Bottom lever kills them by suffocation so you get raw meat
Page 2: Left Button just do a lil suffocation damage so you can kill them with potions and get the xp.

love, malajunta.

All potions start with water and NW. Otherwise you dont get some useless base that can only make a weakness potion after the fact. So always remember if you want anything but a weakness potion,

Page 5: The following listing is a result of the previous potions having FSE added. Not all potions get an effect from FSE being added. RSD GP and GSD can be added at any time, but GP creating splash reduces the effect of RSD. You can not combine RSD and GSD 
Page 6: in a potion without reverting the effect of either GSD or RSD that was previously added. So it is either one or the other.

Page 3: he noticed a small herd of cattle frolicking in the river to cool off as well. He observed as the water splashed up over their thick fur and glistned in the fading sunlight, exposing their lean, muscular torsos. The Miner slowly became aroused.
Page 4: And began dreaming of the time he could feel the hard stiff member of his pants be wet and slippery with the translucent fluids of...... the silky hawt pink moist Honey Pot between her velvety long legs. 
Page 5: He swollowed what little pride he posessed and slowly walked toward the soaked backside of the beast he soon would have deep feelings for. As he entered this lovely specimen he discovered a sensation that he has been lacking for a long while.

Page 1: "No!" Wrynn screamed out, "I wont kill her!" Wrynn shook her head as tears ran down her face. Her childhood friend Kyra knelt down infront of her. Kyra's body was bruised and broken, her hands and feet were bound together. Kyra looked up at her friend and
Page 2: pleaded "Kill me Wrynn, Please I deserve to die." Kyra gasped trying to catch her breath as she choked each word out. "Don't say that Ky, you made a mistake" Wrynn cried kneeling down to be face to face with her friend. Suddenly she was surrounded by 
Page 3: bright lights and she could hear loud screams coming from every direction. She shut her eyes tightly and said to herself "This cant be happening again." Wrynn violently screamed until she opened her eyes and she was laying on the dank forest floor.
Page 4: The nightmares are back, Wrynn thought to herself as she slowly got back to her feet and started gathering her things. It wouldnt be long before the Covenant was back on her tail, she needed to move. As soon as she was ready she looked up to the 
Page 5: sky and let out a distinct whistle and started running. She moved quickly through the forest making sure not to get caught on any of the thorn bushes in her way. Her small lanky body made it easy for her to maneuver the twisting trees and the strangling 
Page 6: vines in her path. She felt every rock and twig in the soft wet earth under her bare feet. She missed the feeling of running through the forest but she knew she could not relish in the feeling for long. She hesitated for just a moment to look at the sky.
Page 7: It was a clear blue day not a cloud in sight. She saw a dark figure approaching her and she knew she had to keep going.

Page 0: Joachim and Alex

This reprehensible pair, a blacksmith and a priest are responsible for the depopulation of Aldertown, a once pretty and productive little hamlet close by.       Alex, the blacksmith, came from that place and embittered by her mother's 
Page 1: criticism regarding the quality of work Alex produced, she set about the seduction of a travelling priest.  Joachim was overly fond of whiskey, the smell of smoke and iron and smutty (quite literally) young ladies, so perhaps 'seduction' isn't really a 
Page 2: crime we can level against Alex, even though Joachim is a man of the cloth and all.  
    The pair set up a stall in the centre of Aldertown, full of potions and promises, in actual fact they simply sold incredibly addictive substances and chased the few 
Page 3: remaining non-junkies into the most unlikely place of defence - The Iron Bar.  After enduring seige conditions for fifteen days (they being fortunate in an abundant supply of local produce as befitting a gastro pub of that calibre) the few remaining sober
Page 4: villagers were overtaken by the green hordes of junkies.  Alex and Joachim committed greatly indecent acts with the captured survivors the likes of which would put De Sade to blushing.   Alex relinquished all claims to her blacksmith heritage
Page 5: upon the sight of her mother wandering aimlessly through the carnage, picking up a spade and then a carrot or a potato, the odd lump of festering flesh here and there.  Victorious she rejoiced in the simple robes of a villager.  
Page 6: When Joachim awoke the next day to the scent of newly scorched flesh, he found an empty town and being overcome with the evil acts he and she had commited and yet also overcome with the love he felt for Alex he found a resolution.  A hard and painful 
Page 7: resolution.  He created The Cane.  A simple switch which he used to beat Alex with every hour until her blood ran.  After the torture sessions he would tell her he loved her and they would spend the remaining thirty minutes sleeping, eating or performing 
Page 8: ablution.  We came upon them in this act and it was not difficult to extract a full confession.  
   We are a peace loving people.  Our temple of doors facilitates our loving nature and our urge to procreate and rejoice.  We have locked them into a 
Page 9: home overlooking our beloved temple in the hope that it's benevolence may bring them peace.  
 
      We are beseiged by the former residents of Aldertown nightly and so by day we bravely make stalwart love in order to replenish our 
Page 10: numbers.  


All those who worship the holy doors of wood are welcome to join us in lascivious prayer for our suffering brethern.  We hope to multiply in great joy until we spill over into Aldertown and raise it up to small town glory
Page 11: of gluttony and mild alcoholism we knew so well.  Praise be to the Doors and the Golden Apple and the Potion of Weakness!  Praise be to the Bars and the Bed!  These holy instruments will bring us to peace and plenty.  We await the Messiah.  The man
Page 12: who drowned his woman in her own tears.  This man, shall by the sweat of his labour and the strength of his seed lead us to great victory!
 
When will the great lover of the bookish lady arrive and set us free from the green tyranny of junky 
Page 13: hoardes?  Come soon, broken hero!  We grow tired and chafe muchly.

It means a lot to me that you trust me enough to grant me permissions to Stumpville. Thank you so much.

I'd also like to say that it was a lot of fun upgrading the iron farm with you.
Page 1: I decided that I would base my gift to you upon what we did together. I hope you like it.

I wish you a very
Merry Christmas
and a New Year
filled with cheer.

Lots of love,

Page 0: Dear Mr_Cortus,

Here is the most awesomest Elf attire in existence! Also I've provided you with a small but substantial supply of Elf Drugs. There seems to be two types: 1, which seems to last a lot longer than 1 but isn't nearly as powerful.
Page 1: I hope you enjoy your Elf paraphernalia gathered from the distant land of North Minepol. I've also included an awesome Fruit Cake as is custom during the holidays. 

Merry Christmas!

Page 1: I first entered the nether with childishness. it was a very suprising world comprised of what i belive to be the minced meat of the damned souls whom have died.

It was no shock that this place with-held strange creatures the like of which ive never seen.
Page 2: I started my studies on the most common of creatures found here; The Zombie Pigman.

The anatomy of this creature resembles a very strong bi-pedal man with the colouring and form of a common pig. most if not all have the ability to use tools.
Page 3: They carry a golden sword, sometimes enchated; of which they smite they're foes.

Hunting in packs these creatures can get very aggressive and it is not wise to trigger they're defensive state.


Page 4: The Blaze is a race of sentient beings comprised of hardened glowstone rods, these rods often catch fire from their sheer compression levels, they are very good fuel.

The Blaze usually only summon around a central summoning block found on nether fortress
Page 5: Ghasts are the most feared of all creatures in the nether, their howling crys shock you to the very bone.

They shoot fireballs out their mouths which are extreemly explosive.
watch out!

they are very easy to kill with a bow an arrow and drop ghast tears
Page 6: Something i have only rarely found are The Magma Slimes/Cubes

much like the overworld equivilent, they come in varying sizes.

Not much to them other than they are guite hot and will burn on touch
Page 7: Wither Skeletons.
rare black skeletons weilding swords.

i know not much of these strange aboninations but of the secret to spawning the most feared creater of all

Collect three wither skelton heads and 4 soul sand. Combine them to make....
Page 8: The Wither.

information has yet to be collected.


Theorys suggest it created a beast trapped by the Endermen

      ADVENTURES
Page 1: The Miner reached his cabin, which was nestled in between two large mountains covered in trees, just by a river which ran out to sea. After such a sweaty afternoon in the mines, he decided it would be nice to have a swim in the river to cool off. 
Page 2: The Miner took off his sweaty clothing and laid it out over the chicken coop, then strolled down the bank to the rivers edge.   he noticed a small herd of cattle frolicking in the river to cool off as well.
Page 3: He observed as the water splashed up over their thick fur and glistned in the fading sunlight, exposing their lean, muscular torsos. The Miner slowly became aroused
Page 4:  The Miner swam to the middle of the river and ducked his head under the water a few times to clear the sweat and grime from his face. Every time he surfaced, he glanced over at the herd of cattle,  who were slowly heading for shelter, except for one cow.
Page 5:  It was standing on the river bank, somewhat intrigued by the Miners physique. He had an idea.

The Miner slowly swam for the bank where the cow was standing, keeping a constant eye on it so it would not become frightened.
Page 6: As he reached the bank, he slowly rose out of the water, making sure the cow could see every inch of his dripping wet body. The cows eyes studied him intently, and seemed focused on his large, wet penis. 
Page 7: The Miner took a few careful steps forward, arms outstretched.
"Stay... stay... Thats'a good girl, good girl..." 
He laid his hands across the cows large backside, and moved behind it.

He was ready.

By the Third Sage of the Church of the Holy Cow

Page 2: would often walk into lava. The Holy Cow gave man the ability to create more cows so that man may spread the greatness of the steer. Wheat is a divine plant, the giver of life and the bringer of bovine glory. Tend it well, and raise the cattle with utmost

     By Stephen King
Page 1: A magical dude got bored, so he made the Earth and people and stuff. The people started talking to a snake, and it all just got really out of hand from there. They ate an apple, which was apparently a pretty big deal because magic dude told them to
Page 2: fuck off... Which they did. Quite vigorously. They made a lot more people, all of whom really kinda sucked. Not about to put up with sucky people, the magic guy decided to drown them all. I can't really blame him. Seriously, these guys were SUCH dicks.
Page 3: Magic man decided to spare two slightly less dickish people so they could drive a big boat o' critters and start the world over again. Because, you know, he couldn't just fucking do that himself, being magic and all and having created the world in the
Page 4: first place. But hey, what do I know? Anyway, they started the world over again and *surprise* the people were still shitty. There were some shenanigans and a lot of people learned valuable lessons, and even more died horrible deaths. Eventually, 
Page 5: magic dude had enough of their crap and decided to go down there himself! He raped a virgin who was already engaged and fathered... himself? I never really got that part. Like he's God, but he's also... his son. I dunno, I guess it's not the weirdest part
Page 6: of this story. Anywho, rape baby dad-son was pretty chill and gave people a bunch of free fish because seriously, who doesn't like free fish? Apparently the Romans don't because they straight up murdered his ass. Maybe they were vegetarians? Wait, no,
Page 7: there was bread there, too. Wow. They must have just been assholes. Anyway, dad-son let it happen because for some reason he thought getting murdered by shitty people would save them from being too shitty. Which makes no goddamn sense. After they killed
Page 8: him he was all, "OHHHH WHAT NOW SUCKAS I'M MAGIC!!1" and came back to life. Somehow nobody seemed impressed and despite being alive again he kinda just went back to Heaven. So it was kinda just like he died anyway. That part was also really unclear.

I hope you did well in league tonight.

I wish we could have skyped a little bit longer, but I know I can't have you all to myself!  

Anyway, in the weapon chest upstairs is a

Also, you were right, you are the best.  And the second best.

Skype with you tomorrow, hopefully.
Good night!!! and

You can trade this book if you want!

Page 0: Soooo.................

Friday night I told her I was divorcing her.  Since then the emotions have been all over the place.  

She'll be angry, then 30 seconds later, crying and sad, 30 seconds after that, she's trying to sleep
Page 1: with me.

I'm sure that all these reactions are normal.  But they are still hard for me to deal with.

I really should have had my new place lined out before telling her.  Hindsight is 20/20 though, right?

Page 2: She even threw a chair at the tv and knocked it over.  

Going back and forth saying she's gonna get full custody of the kids to saying that she doesn't want them.

Every once in a while saying she's gonna kill herself.
Page 3: It makes me feel terrible, but I know she's just saying that stuff to get a rise out of me.

She says that she is gonna fight the divorce and try to take the kids to fix the family.  Like she thinks that will make me love her again, when it will 
Page 4: actually make me resent her more.

I know I've said a lot of stuff about her, most of it just a front.  I don't really hate her.  But she's trying to make a good case for it.  

I didn't go about doing this in the right way,
Page 5: but oh well.  What's done is done.

I'll talk to you later.

We settled in for the night, only to hear the sound of the Civil Defense Service tone on the radio.  We went to our special Christmas Shelter and drank egg nog.

We waited for the all clear but it never came.  The snow piled up over our skylight.  Is it fallout or snow?  We don't know what to do.  Santa did not come.
Page 2: DECEMBER 26, 1963

The eggnog ran out and we were forced to survive on fruit cake and coffee.  We still don't know what's going on outside.  The cookies are not too bad.
Page 3: DECEMBER 27, 1963

What is going on?  We don't have any idea.  Running out of coffee and fruit cake.
Page 4: DECEMBER 28, 1963

We found a tin of rum cake.  A little worse for the wear.

Turns out it was just snow.  The alert was a false alarm.

remember splash effect cuts down on other upgrades like extended. I want to brew for you, if you supply the main ingredient and upgrades your price is $12
Page 6: if you supply main ingredient and ask for upgrades which includes negetive, splash, potency, and or extend the price is $20. if you dont supply anything at all, the price is $23 and if you supply everything meaning the bottle and netherwarts too, then it 
Page 7: is free. but if you want to make me go get the ghast tears, glowstone dust, or rabbit feet, its $60 base price and it goes up from there if you are asking for other upgrades to $75, unless you supply the upgrade components, then it goes back to base price

All potions start with water and NW. Otherwise you dont get some useless base that can only make a weakness potion after the fact. So always remember if you want anything but a weakness potion, 
Page 3: start with NW. An efficient weakness potion would be water and immediately after a FSE. Other than that basic principle, you are set. 

the following listings are a result of NW being previously added.

Page 5: The following listing is a result of the previous potions having FSE added. Not all potions get an effect from FSE being added. RSD GP and GSD can be added at any time, but GP creating splash reduces the effect of RSD. You can not combine RSD and GSD 
Page 6: in a potion without reverting the effect of either GSD or RSD that was previously added. So it is either one or the other.

	Title: Rippers Part 1
	Author: Nimdadotenc
	Type: Written

Page 0: The pounding went on, hour after hour of thudding impacts rocking the dimly-lit underground shelter and sending dust drifting down between the wooden beams and onto the people huddled below. At this point, a full three years since the arrival of the
Page 1: Rippers, the survivors were the quiet ones. Dirty, haunted men with hollow eyes above their scraggly beards leaned against the walls, sometimes with a tired-looking woman curled up beside them. A few of the adults clutched silent children with wide eyes 
Page 2: peering from 
dirty faces, but none of the little ones were crying.
A single tired soldier crouched at the foot of the battered concrete staircase, patiently watching the stainless steel door that sealed the entrance to the shelter. His M-16 
Page 3: rested across his knees, loaded, charged and with the safety off. The carefully-maintained rifle and patched fatigue trousers were all that remained of his U.S. Army uniform; it had been over two years since he or any of the other soldiers in
Page 4: his company had seen pay and nearly six months since any of them had seen an officer, unless you counted orders crackling from an encrypted radio. Of course, you didn't need many officers to run a company that was down to seven men.
Page 5: He silently watched the door, eyes scanning the thick black rubber seal that prevented Rippers from picking up any trace of the huddled survivors in the shelter. But he only half-saw the door; inside he was reliving that horrific first time that he had 
Page 6: seen Rippers firsthand. The number of survivors and soldiers slowly dwindled, but still they kept on, trying to shelter any people they could find, keeping them moving from place to place.
Page 7: A light touch at his shoulder startled Henry and he turned to find one of the refugee women kneeling beside him, holding a steaming MRE bag. The scent of spaghetti sauce wafted from the MRE. He realized the he must have been
Page 8: half-asleep not to have heard her approach or smelled the food. "Thanks" said Henry softly as he carefully leaned his rifle against the wall and accepted the food.
None of the shelters was in any danger of running out of supplies; cases of 
Page 9: MREs and plastic 50-gallon drums of water had been placed in the shelters in the government's last gasp of organized effort. Whoever decided how on the supplies that would be needed must have overestimated the number of survivors there would be;
Page 10: odds were that a lot of the MREs would go bad before anyone ever got around to eating them. There were cases of 5.56mm ammunition too, probably more than the remaining soldiers could go through.
"Mind if I sit with you?" whispered the woman.
Page 11: She eased around to sit on the bottom step without waiting for his answer, slowly lowering her weight to the cold concrete, being careful not to make unnecessary noise.
Henry forked spaghetti into his mouth, glancing up and 
Page 12: noticing that the top few buttons of the her flannel shirt were open. As she leaned forward at the waist, cautiously lowering herself to sit, he looked straight down the front of her shirt and saw her pale, braless tits hanging free. Feeling a sudden rush
Page 13: of embarrassment, he hastily turned back to his food and shoveled down another bite, hoping that she hadn't caught him peeking down her shirt.
"Just like mom used to make, right?" she quietly joked.
Page 14: Henry looked up, and took a good look at her smiling face. She must have been thirty or so, but she looked a little older; her face was clean but without any makeup and Henry thought she looked good. She had dark hair pulled back into a
Page 15: tight ponytail, hazel eyes and a prominent nose. Her womanly figure was mostly hidden by an oversized flannel shirt; her jeans had a small hole in one knee and she wore a man's belt with extra holes punched in it to make it
Page 16: fit around her slender waist.
She tilted her head and looked him over in turn "Are you okay?"
Sudden, crushing fatigue swept through Henry as he struggled to come up with something to say. He 
didn't even know what tumbled out of his
Page 17: mouth until a few seconds after he said it. "Seventeen".
She leaned closer and whispered back "Seventeen? What does that mean?"
Henry took another bite of food slowly chewing and swallowing it down, then gestured tiredly 
Page 18: with his plastic fork towards the handful of survivors curled up together in the shelter. "Seventeen people... sorry, I don't know why I said that." He paused for a moment and then tucked the half-eaten MRE under one arm and offered her his hand.
Page 19: "I'm Henry."
Her hand felt cool and soft in his as they shook. "I'm Claire". 
Claire looked carefully at his face, sitting on the edge of the step and leaning forward to speak. "You look really tired Henry, do you want to try to sleep? I can keep 
Page 20: watch for a little while." 
He thought for a moment and looked down at his food. It had been at least 48 hours since he had been able to sleep for more than just a few minutes. "Would you get me some water please?" He fumbled for the plastic canteen
Page 21: clipped to his belt and held it out to her, hand trembling slightly.
"Of course" she said, smiling and taking the canteen from Henry, carefully rising to her feet and picking her way towards the drum of water at the far end of the shelter.
Page 22: Henry watched as Claire walked away; her jeans looked like they used to be tight but she had lost weight. She still had a very nice backside and for a moment Henry imagined that Claire was putting a little extra sway in her walk for his benefit.
Page 23: 
He rested his face in his hands for a moment and closed his eyes. Unbelievably, Henry felt the stirrings of a hard-on begin as he thought about that tantalizing peek down Claire's shirt and the way her rear looked as she walked away. 
Page 24: For some reason he found the situation funny and he took his face out of his hands and smiled wryly, then quietly laughed. His exhausted chuckles were just winding down when Claire returned with his full canteen. 
Page 25: She smile warily at his tired laughter, moving to stand in front of him and offering the canteen. 
He gratefully accepted it and took a couple deep swallows of the cold, clean water, then lowered the canteen to look up at her. "That's good, thank you".
Page 26: Claire bent at the waist to bring her face down close to his, quietly replying "Glad to be of help". 
He glanced down from her face for just a moment and realized that the front of Claire's shirt was hanging open again and this time it wasn't
Page 27: just a brief glance. The white softness of her breasts hung just a few inches away he could see the profile of one small, dark nipple peeking from the shadows inside her shirt. 
Henry swallowed hard and glanced up to see Claire smiling warmly, 
Page 28: a faint hint of color rising in her cheeks. "You really need to sleep Henry, even if it is just for an hour" she whispered. 
Almost at that moment the regular thudding of the bombardment sputtered to a stop and Henry felt his heart skip a beat.
Page 29: One or two relieved whispers from the people scattered around the shelter reached his ears as the exhausted survivors gratefully curled up against one another to try to snatch their first real sleep in two days.
Page 30: Claire reached down and took Henry's hand in hers, tugging him to his feet. He rose, swaying slightly with exhaustion and looked down at her face. Her smile was gone, replaced with slightly-parted lips and a smoky look. 
Page 31: 
Henry plucked his rifle from where it rested against the wall and followed Claire as she padded up a few of the concrete steps, then turned and sat. He slid quietly down beside her, clicking on the safety of his M-16 and laying it flat on the step above
Page 32: the one they were sitting on.
The was really no chance of privacy in the shelter, but sitting there at the top of the steps they were partially concealed in the shadows cast by the dim chemical lights hanging in the corner. One or two of the people curled
Page 33: up on the floor could have been watching from underneath half-closed eyes, but Henry and Claire soon forgot that anyone else was there. 
Claire leaned in close and rested her head on Henry's shoulder, smiling as she felt him put an arm around her.

Page 0: She tilted her head up and found him waiting for her; their lips brushed gently, then he pressed his mouth firmly over hers and pulled her tight against him as they kissed.
In the dim light, their eyes met and Claire brought her lips under 
Page 1: Henry's stubbled jaw, 
lightly kissing and nibbling his neck and up towards his ear. 
While his left arm held her close, Henry slowly ran his right hand from Claire's knee up to her thigh. She moaned softly in approval as his hand drifted up to cup one
Page 2: full breast through her flannel shirt, feeling her hard nipple pressing against his palm through the heavy fabric.
As Henry's strong hand squeezed one breast and then the other, Claire nuzzled his neck, tasting and smelling him. She let 
Page 3: one hand slip down to his lap and moved until she found the bulge of his growing erection pressing against his fatigue trousers. She squeezed him through his pants and he turned and brought his mouth back to hers.
Page 4: As their tongues played, Claire worked at the button closure and zipper of his trousers, finally opening them and reaching inside to wrap her fingers around him. 
"Shhhhhh" she said,
Page 5: pulling Henry's erect cock up and out of his pants as he barely suppressed a loud groan.
Claire wrapped her small fingers tightly around the hairy base of Henry's thick erection, slowly stroking him up and down. She ran her 
Page 6: thumb over the swollen head, feeling a slippery drop of warm precum oozing from his slit. Henry leaned his head back, groaning quietly again and still squeezing one soft breast through her shirt.
Henry watched Claire through a haze of lust 
Page 7: as she slowly stroked his engorged member up and down, taking her hand away once and moistening her fingers in her mouth, then rubbing the slickness of her spit all over his purple head.
Page 8: Finally, she pulled free of him and stood, quickly unbuckling her belt and unzipping her jeans. She pushed the jeans down to her knees, taking her white panties with them and quietly shuffled around to stand in front of Henry.
Page 9: He spread his knees wide, watching the perfect white roundness of Claire's ass as she leaned forward in front of him, exposing damp brown curls that hid the moist pinkness between her pale thighs. The she reached back between her legs, wrapping her
Page 10: small fingers around the root of Henry's cock and slowly eased herself down until the throbbing tip brushed her hairy outer lips.
Henry groaned deep in his chest and Claire gave a little mewling gasp as she let her weight slowly push her down against his 
Page 11: trembling cock, gently moving him back and forth with her hand until the hard tip came to rest against the slick inner opening of her wet pussy. Claire sat down onto his erect tool, feeling the swollen head inch up into her clinging folds, 
Page 12: slowly working up into her until all six inches of the rigid shaft was clutched deep inside.
Claire felt Henry's hands take her hips in a tight grip and she rested her hands on his, letting her tender pussy become used to the thick erection that
Page 13: she was sitting on. After a moment, she leaned forward a little, raising herself off Henry's lap and letting a couple inches of his rock-hard dick slip out of her drenched pussy. Then she eased back down onto him, feeling the top of his shaft 
Page 14: scrape with delicious friction against a tender place inside her dripping channel. 
Slowly she worked up and down on Henry's cock, relishing the feel of his hardness piercing the wet softness of her snatch. The skin at the base of 
Page 15: while that beautiful rubbing and pressing inside her kept happening at the bottom of each stroke, as the crown of his cock forced it's way past a sensitive, swollen spot deep inside.
Suddenly Henry leaned forward,
Page 16: pressing his face against the back of her flannel shirt as he began to thrust with his hips, lifting himself from the concrete step with each stroke. Claire's ponytail brushed Henry's face as she grabbed his hands and guided 
Page 17: them under her shirt, letting him seize a soft breast in each hand. Then she just held on to Henry's arms, her legs trembling a little as she struggled to hold herself in place for him. She kept her tight pussy hovering right over Henry's lap, 
Page 18: letting him drive himself up into her grasping wetness as hard and fast as he wanted.
Henry thrust steadily into Claire's willing body, pulling her tightly against him and squeezing her tits hard as he felt numbness 
Page 19: beginning to spread from his balls up to the root of his cock. Sensing that he was close, Claire reached one hand down between her thighs, pressing two fingers over her clit and slowly dragging them down to where Henry's
Page 20: cock was sliding in and out of her dripping snatch. She pulled the damp fingers back up and over her clit and began rubbing up and down in time to his thrusts.
Claire heard Henry's breathing begin to turn ragged and he let off a
Page 21: small, gasping moan as he started to shorten his strokes, rapidly slipping the last few inches of his hard dick in and out of her slippery snatch. Without the wonderful pressure of his cock pressing against that soft, tender place 
Page 22: inside her, Claire felt her orgasm begin to slip away, but she began to rub her sensitive clit faster hoping that she might make it anyway. 
Suddenly, she felt a rush of slickness inside her as Henry's trembling cock began 
Page 23: shooting thick strings of cum into her pussy. He made a last few ragged strokes, crushing Claire in a tight grip as he filled her slippery cleft with semen. She smiled as Henry gave a soft gasp of pleasure and loosened his arms
Page 24: around her, relaxing his grip on her sore breasts. Henry lowered his hips and sat back onto the step, allowing the tip of his still-hard cock to slip free of her drenched pussy.
Claire felt a mixture of his semen and her 
Page 25: juices dripping out of her and she slipped her fingers down to capture the slippery drippings and rub them over her taut clitoris. It felt good, but she didn't think she could come. With a little sigh, but a happy smile on her face, she 
Page 26: braced her hands on Henry's thighs and stood, bending to grab her jeans and panties and tug them back up. 
As she quickly zipped her jeans, Claire began to feel a deep ache in her thighs from squatting over Henry the way she had, plus
Page 27: her boobs felt a little bruised. She wished she had been able to climax, but she knew that Henry would feel better and hopefully he would be able to sleep a little bit.
Henry sat back, floating in a post-orgasmic afterglow as
Page 28: Claire rose from his lap, shadows playing across the pale skin of her ass. He caught a brief glimpse of pink wetness as she bent to pull her jeans up; Claire's soft brown pubic hair was tangled and slicked with a mixture of Henry's 
Page 29: thick white semen and her own juices. For a moment her felt his erection start to stir, but he sleepily dismissed the urge.
Claire sat back down beside Henry on the step as he fumbled to tuck his wet, half-erect
Page 30: penis back into his fatigue trousers and button up. Finally he was able to settle in a little bit and put one arm around her as she rested her head on his shoulder.
For just a moment, Henry forgot about Rippers, steel doors and survivors. 
Page 31: Exhaustion, coupled with the buzz of post-coital hormones and the warmth of the woman pressed against his side pushed him into sleep and darkness settled over him like a blanket.
Page 32: In the dimness of the shelter, eighteen survivors slept.

	Title: BDSM Guide
	Author: Nimdadotenc
	Type: Written

Page 0: 
BDSM is one of several overall names given to a collection of behaviors that involve bondage, spanking, domination, and other activities that are done in a safe, consensual, non-abusive manner and in an erotic context. BDSM is a form of
Page 1: erotic play that involves 
significant physical and emotional risks, and thus requires instruction in order to do so with reasonable safety. Accordingly, we make the following recommendations for beginners. Please understand that the tips 
Page 2: below do not provide, nor are they meant to provide, complete instruction.
Do BDSM only with people you know well and are on good terms with, and when both of you are in a good mood. Trying to do it with strangers, or when
Page 3: either of you is tired or upset, dramatically increases the degree of risk. Avoid significant use of intoxicants. If you're not in condition to drive, you're not in condition to do BDSM.
Keep "reality" out of it. Unless both of you 
Page 4: specifically agree to it 
ahead of time, BDSM play is not a proper occasion to "punish" someone for a "real world" offense. Unpaid parking tickets, dirty dishes left in the sink, and so forth get handled outside the BDSM play.
Page 5: The more empathy you have, the better you'll be at this. If you reasonably and safely can, experience something yourself before you do it to another person.
Page 6: Prepare for emergencies. Have needed supplies close by, including a first aid kit, a fire extinguisher, and flashlights. Take training in First Aid and CPR at least once a year.
Page 7: Play with a "silent alarm" in place. When you play with somebody new in private, tell a trusted friend where you'll be and who you'll be with. 
Page 8: Make sure, diplomatically, that you tell your prospective partner ahead of time that you will be doing this, and encourage him or her to do the same.
Page 9: Negotiate what you'll do ahead of time. This is not the time to have a mismatch of expectations. Handle such matters as sexual behavior, safer sex precautions, type and degree of bondage, physical and emotional limits, and so forth before you play. 
Page 10: Stay within these limits while you play. If your session goes well, there's always next time. Check in with each other afterwards, perhaps the next day. Discuss what did and what didn't work, and what you might do next time.
Page 11: Agree upon a safeword or two. These are special phrases used to indicate that the activity "really" needs to be slowed, changed, or stopped. Refusal to honor a safeword is very serious misconduct; it can even be a crime.
Page 12: It's a good idea for the dominant to "check in" with the submissive several times during the session. (Sometimes submissives find it difficult to use their safewords, even when they should.) 
Page 13: One good non-verbal check-in is for the dominant to give the submissive's hand two light but firm squeezes. If the dominant gets two squeezes back, it means that the submissive is basically all right.
Page 14: Avoid toys that have sharp edges or corners. Instruments used for spanking, whipping, and so forth should be carefully rounded off.
Page 15: Start lightly and build slowly. A too-rapid increase in the physical or emotional intensity of the play is the direct cause of many problems.
Page 16: 
The submissive can use the "one to ten" technique to indicate they're ready to feel a paddle or whip stroke, and its intensity. "One" is a feather-light touch; "ten" is a full-power stroke.
Page 17: As a rule, strokes from whips and paddles are delivered to fleshy, muscled body areas such as the lower buttocks. It's very dangerous to strike your partner over their kidneys, liver, spleen, or tailbone.
Page 18: Use only soft, plain paraffin candles for hot wax play. Harder candles, such as beeswax candles, have a melting point high enough to cause burns.
Page 19: Spring-loaded wooden clothespins can work well as erotic clamps on the nipples, the genitals, and other locations. Various clamps found in office supply stores can also work well. Keep in mind that clamping an area shuts off its circulation. 
Page 20: Experts vary regarding how long clamps can be left on, but most express their opinions in terms of minutes. Clamps hurt most when coming off. Self-experimentation is recommended here.
Page 21: Do not attempt to do piercings or other activities that involve breaking the skin unless you have studied under, or are being supervised by, an knowledgeable individual.
Page 22: Bondage creates dangerous vulnerability. We recommend that you let someone tie you up, blindfold you, or gag you only after you have first done at least two successful BDSM scenes with them that involved no bondage.
Page 23: There is never any need to tie some part of your partner's body so tightly that it "goes to sleep." If this happens, loosen the bondage.
Do not leave a bound person alone. 
Page 24: As a general rule, stay as close to a bound person as you would to an infant left in your care. (If you gag them, stay even closer.)
Page 25: You should be able to free a bound person within one minute of an emergency occurs, even if they have fainted. Wise BDSM players keep special "paramedic scissors" or similar items handy to help with this.
Page 26: We advise caution when playing with any form of self-bondage. 
After extensive medical consultation, we have been unable to discover any form of suffocation or strangulation play that is not unpredictably life-threatening
Page 27: This is not an exhaustive list by any means.
Please use common sense and communication when experimenting with this form of sex play, and as always, be careful of each other

Page 0: Fallen Angel
It's an average Saturday night in town. I'm out wit my freinds enjoying myself. It's a fancy dress night and we decided to go out as Angels and Devils.
I'm wearing a tightly corseted white dress that stops an inch or two below my ass, my 38D 
Page 1: tits are bursting to be free an I have innocent wings and a halo. I know people are staring, girls give me filthy looks and guys are pratically drooling but I ignore them all and carry on dancing, grinding up against my girlfreinds and swining around the 
Page 2: poles. You've been watching me all nightfrom across the bar.You've seen more than most, you know I'm not wearing any panties because when I slipped off my 6in white stillettos you had a perfect view of my juicy bare pussy.
Page 3: The night goes on and the drinks keep coming and soon it's time to go home. You call a cab but when it arrives I get in. You jump in quickly and try to tell me to get out but I just smile and askyou to drop me off first. You agree but soon into the drive
Page 4: you notice the driver keeps looking back in his mirror, you turn to me and I've fallen asleep with my legs spread wide so the driver has a perfect view of my glistening pussy. You push my legs shut and give the driver your address. When he arrives he
Page 5: shoots you a wink as you pay and I wake up, you tell me we have arrived at my house so I get out without realising you've got out to. It's not until the taxi has driven away that I realise I have no idea where we are, I turn and start yelling at you but
Page 6: you just calmly walk up to me and kiss me, your tongue forces it's self into my mouth, I try to pull back but you grab my hair and continue for a few minutes, then without letting go of my hair you guide me towards your house and into your living room.
Page 7: 
I don't even notice your two house mates are sat watching the TV, all I can feel is your hand in my hair and your lips on my neck, without warning you sink your teeth into my neck and I scream clearly getting the attention of your friends.
Page 8: The TV is quickly switched off and all eyes are on me. My juices are already starting to slide down my thighs and I'm in a strange state between terrified and turned on. You whisper in my ear "get on your knees"and without even thinking I obey. 
Page 9: and without even thinking I obey. I stay there while you chat with your friends, the waiting is driving me crazy and I can't resist putting a hand between my legs.I close my eyes and start to relax into my pleasure when a hard slap across my face 
Page 10: jolts me out of my ecstasy. "Your a filthy fucking slut, rubbing your soaking pussy in front of strangers. Look at how wet your fingers are, your going to lick them clean one by one or your goingto have your whole fist stuffed into your cunt.
Page 11: I look into your eyes and I know you mean it so I start quickly licking each finger. "Slow down you stupid bitch, clean them like you'd clean a cock, it's pretty clear you'll know how to do that." I start licking slowly and to make sure I've got 
Page 12: ll my juice I suck each one. I can see all three of you have a hardon but yours interests me the most, I can see from the bulge in your jeans you've got a big cock and I know I want it inside me. 
One of your friends turns some music on
Page 13: and you tell me to get up, "let's see you dance like you did in the club, anyone would have thought it was a strip club the way you were acting you fucking slut." I start to sway to the music but I'm to self conscious to do anything else. You come close 
Page 14: up behind me and I feel your breath on my neck. "Dance bitch" you whisper aggressively in my ear. I start to move my hips more and I can feel the bulge in your jeans rubbing against my ass. I grind into you more and feel your hands on my tits, 
Page 15: you push them up until they fall over the top of my dress. You start to pinch both my nipples and my breathing becomes heavy. When you let go of one I barely notice as the pain from the other tingles down to my clit like electric. I'm grinding harder 
Page 16: and harder against you until suddenly I feel your dick enter my cunt. I moan so loud as you start pumping your hard thick cock into me. I grind back against you desperate to have more. I open my eyes and your friends are stroking their cocks through their
Page 17: jeans, this drives me over the edge and you feel my pussy clench around you as I let out a loud moan of ecstasy. Suddenly I feel warm spurts of your cum filling my cunt and I cum again. Then I feel empty, your cocks slid out from me and I feel disapointed
Page 18: I feel your hand on my head pushing me back down to my knees. As soon as I see your wet dick I slide it into my mouth, I taste our cum and lick at your shaft until it's gone, delighting in the taste. You lift your cock and I lick and suck on your balls to
Page 19: taste every drop.
I sit on the floor still panting and you just walk away. I stare at the floor my face going red as I realise what I've done. I feel your friends staring at me and it just makes my face burn more with embarrassment. I sense you come back
Page 20: into the room. You move my hair and place a collar tight around my throat. "Your mine now you pathetic little bitch. You will do as you are told and you will like it." You attach a lead and pull me into the hall on all fours and your friends follow.
Page 21: My face is glowing because I can feel them staring at my cum dribbling pussy. You take me into the bathroom, your friends strip me of my clothes and I'm lifted into the bath. Still on my hands and knees I'm so uncomfortable. I hear a shower being turned
Page 22: and suddenly a cold jet of water hits my back. I shiver as you wash down my head and body. I let out a scream as the strong stream of cold water hits my clit. You hold it there and I can feel myself about to cum but it stops.
Page 23: You wait for me to calm down before aiming the water at my cunt, I feel it entering and washing away your cum. It's not long before I'm on the edge of orgasm and once again you stop. I stay shivering in the tub, believing it's over but your not done with 
Page 24: me yet.
I hear the water start again, you leave it running and make me wait. Then, with no warning I feel the jet of water spray hard against my ass hole. I clench, but it's no use the water is to strong. Once again it enters me, I am torn
Page 25: between pain, humiliation and pleasure. The water stops and I clench again but harder, I wont let you see me disgrace myself like that. I'm lifted out of the bath and then you all leave. I take your absence as a chance to final relieve myself.
Page 26: Ten minutes later you return and it's clear I have emptied myself. Your throw me a towel and I dry myself. "That's better you nasty little whore, now your clean inside and out." You snatch the towel from me, grab my lead and pull me hard, dragging me back
Page 27: out to the living room. Your mates are playing Fifa and you sit down to watch making me sit next to you like a dog. You light two cigarettes and pass me one, I appreciate the gesture and when I'm done I lean against your leg I'm exhausted and feel you 
Page 28: stroking my hair I fall asleep.

	Title: The Movie II
	Author: Nimdadotenc
	Type: Written

Page 0: I screech. What. The. Fuck? 
The bastard hid a paddle somewhere within reach of his spot on the sofa. No fair! Those ridiculously long arms are not supposed to be able to reach a paddle and smack my ass with it! Now I'll be punished with that? NOT FAIR. 
Page 1: I am positively livid. Also wickedly turned on. My ass fucking smarts and he lands a few more solid thwacks with that paddle on my ass and thighs. I start I bucking and wrestling with him. 
Page 2: I break free from his arms with a loud yell and launch myself into him.I yank a leg out of one pant leg and growl as I straddle him. I kiss him using teeth and pin him against the back of the couch. He is surprised but laughing at my quick strength.
Page 3: His hands grab at my hips while I extract his very very hard cock. 
I am animalistic as I sink my wet pussy onto his him. I'm surprised he's this hard again. I'm surprised at how wet I am. 
Page 4: I bite his lower lip while grinding against him, fucking him and sliding his hard cock in and out of me. 
It's so fucking good, the friction, the heat, the carnal fuck. His hands grab my hips, one hand sneaks around to feel my ass - it's on fire.
Page 5: I grow even more feral as I hump his cock, fucking him as hard as I can. His hand smacks my ass and I yell again and try to pin his hand. 
He just laughs and cups my ass cheeks and flips me over so that he's above me. I am not beaten, 
Page 6: but I want his cock, 
so I bend my legs up and he starts drilling me hard, his balls slapping against my ass. I can feel the blanket underneath my sore ass, his cock pressing into every inch of my cunt, all the way inside me. 
Page 7: I put my leg up on his shoulder and push against him as if to wrestle more. He looks at me wickedly and bites the instep of my foot while I yowl. 

Fucker. 
Page 8: I reach down and grab the root of his cock, feeling my juices coating his balls and tighten my fingers around the base of it. 
Page 9: He grabs my hand and hauls them up above me, pinning me to the couch. I struggle again, bucking up into his cock. It only turns him on more. The man has the staying power of a 19 year old. 
Page 10: "That's right my little slut, you get my cock after having your punishment. I get to fuck you the way I want to. Take my cock as I fuck you hard. And you better fucking come only when I tell you to."
Page 11: I am on fire, my body arching up into him, fucking him as he drills into me. I can't hold back. 
"Please. Oh fuck. Please." I hear myself say. 
"Say it." He says. 
"Please, can I fucking come on your cock Sir?" I pant. 
Page 12: He thrusts his hips again harder than before and I can feel his cock hitting every nerve ending in my pussy. 
Page 13: "PLEASE SIR! Please may I come?" I am begging now in earnest. Now rabid and crazed, begging, pleading. Asking for fucking mercy. "Please Oh Please can I come. Oh fuck. Oh please" I beg. 
Page 14: "Come" He says. 

My cunt grabs his cock and I crest into a wave of bright white and yellow. I spasm around his cock as he thrusts twice more before groaning and collapsing onto me. 
Page 15: 
"Fuck yeah." He says, looking up at me with a grin. "I guess I just needed dinner, a movie and a good fuck."

	Title: The Movie I
	Author: Nimdadotenc
	Type: Written

Page 0: John has been under so much pressure at work. He's on the committee to hire the new dean and there's a lot of contentious politics around it all. It's just fucking driving him nuts. At dinner today, he was explaining 
Page 1: some of the bullshit that one of his colleagues keeps pulling and it makes me want to go smack some sense into the irritating entitled economist who thinks he's got all the answers. Academics can be such assholes. 
Page 2: He wants to watch a movie, so we've settled onto the couch with me leaning against his chest with his arm around me. I love this position, it feels so safe and comfortable. I pull the blanket up as the movie starts - he picked the movie this time. 
Page 3: It's ok, I'm sort of following it - it's got subtitles which reminds me that it's worth having a man around who likes gadgets and insists on the largest flat screen TV. The movie has sweeping vistas and interesting characters. There are
Page 4: beautiful fight scenes with kung fu I think? I'm pretty sure that's why he picked it - he loves martial arts movies. 
I'm surprised to find that I'm enjoying the story so far. The fight scenes are quite beautiful, it looks like dancing and the story
Page 5: includes beautiful women who are vicious and fierce. I like that. They don't lie down and take it, they get up and fight.
In one scene, two characters are in a mountain hideaway, a male and a female. Themale is keeping the woman there, and she
Page 6: is fighting it. She knocks him over the head with a rock and runs away. But they're so isolated that he easily tracks her and brings her back to the cave so he can take care of her and keep her as a captive. When she wakes, he tends to
Page 7: her. She tries to fight him, he puts his hand down her pants and tames her by touching her pussy. She kisses back, rolls him on top and starts kissing and grinding against him. 
The camera cuts away, and then we are to presume that after sex 
Page 8: they've fallen in love. Oh and also, the scene has really fucking turned me on.
John notices that I've gotten more into the movie, my body stiffening and moving slightly. When the sex scene finishes he whispers into my ear. "Oh you liked that did you?"
Page 9: I feel warm and I'm pretty sure I blush. He reaches his hand down against the flat of my stomach and rests his fingers on my pussy, just at the top where my clit is. His finger dips lightly down between my pussy lips. 
Page 10: "Oh my. You did like that, you naughty little slut." 
He has my attention. 
"The problem my dear is that there's more of this this movie to watch, and you are already a slut in heat. Aren't you?" 
Page 11: His fingers are light on my clit, but my hips are moving already. 
"I want to finish this movie, my lovely little harlot, so let's stop for a moment so you can grind against my fingers and give yourself an orgasm. Ok?"
Page 12: He stops the movie and I lean back into him while his fingers curve into my pussy. It's an awkward angle, but I manage to move my hips so that it feels good. I'm one of those women who are blessed to be able to 
Page 13: 
come quickly and I do because I know he wants to get back to the movie. I buck against his fingers while he whispers in my ear "Yeah that's right, ride my fingers with your cunt my sweet little slut." 
Page 14: My body relaxes once I come, he keeps his fingers gently on my clit. I'm not done, he knows I need more. He pulls his fingers slowly out of my cunt as he clicks the movie on with the remote. He reaches his fingers up to my mouth so that I can lick 
Page 15: the juices off of them. I know it turns him on. 
But the man has control like no one I've ever met, and he keeps watching the movie. There's another fight scene. I'm losing track of what is happening but I don't care because he pulls up my shirt 
Page 16: and starts playing gently with my tits. He knows I already took my bra off and he knows how torturous I find it when he plays with my breasts. 
His fingertips circle the flesh slowly. Then he cups one and thumbs the nipple.
Page 17: Then he returns to the other one and does the same.
The movie continues. There's more fighting, there's talking and some scenes with long conversations in Chinese or whatever they're speaking. I'm not really paying attention. 
Page 18: His fingers on my tits feel like everything. He is pulling at them slightly, pinching very lightly. He pulls the blanket down so that my breasts are exposed to the cooler air. My nipples are obediently hard. 
Page 19: He looks at me and smiles. Then looks back at the movie. 
I turn my body so he has easier access and he strokes and cups my breasts, circling my nipples and then pinching and pulling. I can see my nipple stretching as he pulls on them.
Page 20: I can't help moaning and panting. He is slow, deliberate. I try not to move but squirm anyway. 
He's a fucking tease. 
Then there's another fight scene and even though I'm barely watching, I can feel him get more intense. 
Page 21: His hand grabs my breasts harder, his fingers pinch my nipple as he cups and kneads the whole of my breast. Then he pinches them in earnest and I feel the jolt right down to my clit. Now I'm breathing hard and writhing. He pinches and pulls. 
Page 22: He isn't gentle now. He is watching as the characters clash swords. Are those fingernails scratching me? 
I'm panting now. I am wanton and wanting. I'm about to put my hands down to my clit again when the fight scene ends and he pauses the movie. 
Page 23: "What am I going to do with you my little hussy? You can't seem to keep yourself still so I can watch my movie. What a bad little slut you are." 
I know he loves me, I know he is saying this to turn us both on. I know he wants me as
Page 24:  much as I want him. But god those words get to me. 
"Get your fucking mouth around my cock while I watch my movie." He orders me. 
I happily flip over on my stomach, unzip his cock and in one breath, swallow as much of him as I can.
Page 25: He groans and flips on the television again. 
"Suck me slowly." 
I love being servile like this, turned into his sex toy while he watches television. He fondles my tits and yanks down my pants so he can reach my cunt. I lick him slowly and reverently. 
Page 26: He is almost absentminded as his fingers feel at my wetness. 
"So wet, such a little slut you are. No coming until I say so." 
He returns to watching the movie with a hand lightly scratching my back as I lick his balls slowly,
Page 27: trying not to drool on the couch as I keep trying to slow myself down so that he can feel pleasure, so that he can watch the movie. 
Another fight scene comes, this one seems like the final scene, though I'm barely paying attention. 
Page 28: His fingers rest in the back of my hair and pulls a handful of it and starts pumping my head on his cock at the speed he wants. I'm so turned on that I reach a hand down to play with my clit as he uses my mouth. 
Page 29: "Good girl, take my cock. That's it" he mutters as the music crescendos. "Fuck. Take it." he moans. I can feel that he's about to come in my mouth, feel his body tense and when he comes spurting into my throat,
Page 30: I can't help but fuck my fingers and come with him. 
We both collapse and I look over to see the credits running. He clicks the TV off. 
"Damn that was good." I say grinning up at him. He leans down and kisses my forehead. 
Page 31: "It was my love. You're really good at sucking me." 
I smile happily. "Thanks, you know how much I love doing it." 
His face grew darker. "There's just one thing you naughty girl, you just came without permission didn't you?"
Page 32: I bit my lip. I didn't think he caught that. 
"Umm... yes... I guess I did Sir." I stammer. 
"I thought so. Well you know I need to redden your ass for that don't you?"
If possible, my cunt gets even wetter than before and my nipples tingle. 
Page 33: "Oh, I mean, I don't think it's necessary - I mean. It's not really fair for you to spank me, I mean, I didn't mean to come... it was just that your cock was turning me on so much and I had just had you playing with my tits and I mean,
Page 34: how much am I supposed to take?" 
His face is impassive as I speak. 
"What did I tell you when you were sucking my cock?" 
I look down at the floor. Suddenly words are difficult. "You told me not to come... unless you told me to... Sir." 
Page 35: "And what happened when I came in your mouth?"
"Um... I came... from rubbing my pussy... But it's just that... "
"Such a naughty pussy, getting you into so much trouble."
"But" I said feeling the heat get into my face, "I just. I was turned on Sir..." 
Page 36: I'm not sure why I'm fighting him, it just feels so unfair to be punished for coming during such a lovely delicious blowjob. 
He reaches his arm out to grab my arm so that he can lay me over his lap and I halfheartedly smack his hand out of the way.
Page 37: "Oh ho... My slut wants to play does she?" 
"No it's just that I don't... I shouldn't have to be spanked." I can hear the whine in my voice. I don't even believe myself. 
He reaches over again and pulls me quickly so that I land over his lap.
Page 38: I squirm as he pins my hand behind my back and I push against his leg with my other hand. 
"No!!" I say, kicking my feet and fighting him. "I don't deserve this." 
Keeping me pinned, he says quietly "I think you do, you little saucy slut.
Page 39: I think you need to be taught a lesson for hitting me with that rock and running away. You get orgasms but I haven't yet taught you a lesson for giving me such a bad headache and having to go rescue you." 
Page 40: He's pulling me into the movie, the fantasy world we just left. I am turned on and hot. But it still feels good to fight. And I remember faintly that the women in this movie like to fight. 
Page 41: "I think you want this, no... I think you NEED this my sweet little minx. You need to be punished. Plus, you know you have a way out don't you? Just say your safe word and you know I'll let you go."
Page 42: I squirm and wriggle at the mention of my safe word. He's reminding me that I have a choice. Reminding me that I can always call this off if I want to. He's letting me know that he loves me but that if I don't say something, my ass is going to get redend
Page 43: The truth is that I want it. 
"Besides, you know how molten hot your sweet pussy gets whenever I spank you hard don't you?" His voice is liquid smooth as I struggle to get out of his wicked arm pin and the way he has taken advantage of my
Page 44: pants around my thighs to keep my legs from kicking. 
His hand is slowly tracing my ass and stroking the tender skin between my asscheeks and at the cleft between my ass and thigh. 
God dammit, I'm turned on again. 
Page 45: His hand lands on my ass. SMACK. 
SMACK. 
SMACK. 
I lose track of the blows as they come quicker and quicker. I wrestle and struggle, but he is bigger than me, his hand is big and flat and it lands over and over on my upturned ass. 
Page 46: I move to fight him and turn my body so that my legs are straddling his thigh even though my pants are preventing me from opening my legs very wide. He spanks even harder as my mons comes into contact with the rise of his leg.
Page 47: I push my hips up against his knee so I can get sweet friction against my clit. I am humping his leg. 
"Oh, no little slut. I know you're turned on, but you don't get to hump me like a little bitch in heat. 
Page 48: This is a [SMACK] fucking [SMACK] punishment [SMACK] and I want you feral after I'm done with you." He yanks my body back over his whole lap. I'm embarrassed at being found out and wildly turned on. 
Page 49: His hand slides over the radiant heat of my ass and then suddenly disappears, so I try to wriggle unobtrusively. Maybe I can get myself free while he's distracted. Suddenly I feel a SMACK that is even louder and more painful than before.

Or even make the

Page 0: Day 153

These past days have been filled with such success, my heart overflows with joy. I've learned so much from subject C. He's taught me much about the existance of another world. A world with a cure, I hope.
Page 1: Day 10,

Our subject today has been wholly boring. It has done nothing but slam itself against it's walls trying to reach us. It's broken several bones in it's attempt. If we can cure it, what life will it have?
Page 2: Day 50,

It's just me now.
Page 3: Day 170,

I found the door to the other world. There were wonders, and monstrocities untold there. Legends never came close to describing it. There were undead mutations walking freely, but nothing living. No cure.
Page 4: 


I don't know how much longer I can do this.
Page 5: Day 2,

I've just started to get used to the moans at night. Brian has been wonderful, holding me at night so I can sleep and smiling at me when I wake from my dreams. I asked him to marry me when we leave here.
Page 6: Food doesn't taste good anymore. I take notes, but I don't feel happy. I stopped counting the days. I discovered a new world, but there's no point. I can't bring him back.

Page 0: Day 1 

Subject B has finally arrived. It was found in the wild just like subject A, and all the symptoms seem to be the same. Rotten flesh, an unending hunger for meat, and complete lack of higher brain functions. 
Page 1: Day 5

Subject B has broken a few fingers and seems to have injured his left shoulder trying to reach me by repeatedly slamming against the glass. We'll have a few more days of observation before beginning tests.
Page 2: Day 12

Subject B, along with Subject A have both had their behaviors recorded and studied, so we'll begin with the tests. Tomorrow I'll try various things they might encounter in nature to see if this problem could resolve itself
Page 3: Day 13

We lost Subject A today. I brought him outside to see if he was affected by the sun at all, when he burst into flames! His skin bubbled and boiled before he finally succombed to his final slumber.
Page 4: Day 15

It's just Subject B now, and it's slow going. Every vaccine I try on him has to be given time to take effect, and with only one subject Brian and I are getting antsy. There's a crisis outside and we're just watching Subject B.
Page 5: Day 30 

No notable change has occured. Nothing. And we've only managed to do a few tests with just Subject B. I hope The Company sends us a replacement for A soon.
Page 6: Day 35,

I wrote to The Company about our slow progress, and they sent us a care package to help. It had uppers and caffiene pills in it. Thanks. We get the message.
Page 7: Those pills weren't what we thought. Brian took some last night and now he

Page 8: I suppose the company did what I asked. I have a new Subject A.

No change to Subject B.
Page 9: Day 60

Subject B does not seem affected by either Subject A or C. He remains unchanged. The only constant in this place. His cold, unchanging eyes bore into mine, and I think of how they are rotting. I think of how I too must be rotting.
Page 10: Day 100

Subject B is useless. He hasn't told me a single thing about a cure Why is he here? Why am I here? Why did The Company do this to us? Why? Why? WHy? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?WHYWHYWHYWHWYWHYWHYWHWYHWYHWHWYHWYWHYWHWYHWYHWYWHWYH

Page 0: Once upon a time there was a tiny cafe' owned an operated by a mean old lady. This mean old lady sold terrible coffee at high prices.

She was also very mean to children. 
Page 1: Then one day she went out for a bagel, because she was too cheap to stock them in her own cruddy shop. 
She slipped off the curb and hit her head!

What were patrons of her crappy coffee shop to do?!
Page 2: Well, as it turns out, the old lady died instantly, which was a shame because she was a real bitch. 

Her coffee shop was purchased by a small band of Portland Hipsters. 

They tried to name it Stumptown Coffee,
Page 3: but that name was already trademarked. 

By the way, capitalism is a terrible system.

Anyway, these hipsters redecorated the place to make it modern and adorable, and that is how Mako Bean Hipster Cafe was born!
Page 4: Pieces of the old lady's spirit lived on. Every once in awhile you could hear a faint whisper of a raspy cough.
Sometimes, the neighborhood children report, they even heard her wail "wash your filthy hands, you shitty little bastards!"
Page 5: followed by "and tell your lazy ass parents to get off their goddamned computers and spend some fucking time with yooooouuuu......."

Page 0: Memoirs of a Snowman
by Frosty

All the jingle bells are sending fireworks into the sky. Snow is falling and just like snowflakes, Frosty is one of a kind!

"Frosty's memoirs are cold and mysterious."
-Sunny McShinalot
Page 1: I was born on a winters day. It was just after halloween and children were playing in the snow.

I don't know my mother or my father. My first memories were falling, falling and landing softly on a cushioned floor. The next memory I had were as if I
Page 2: materialised into thin air.
When I walk, it was as if I left a trail of cold thin air behind me. No one wanted to be around me.

I spent many days wondering beneath the canopy of trees. Trees children would take into their homes.
Page 3: I wished they'd take me inside instead. Play with me and idolise me like they did those trees.

They would sing to the trees and offer presents wrapped in colourful paper. 

I felt so lonely.
Page 4: One day, I met this tall black man. He seemed aloof.
One minute he was there, the next minute he wasn't.
He would randomly pick up dirt and place it somewhere else. There didn't seem to be any order. It was like he was on drugs.
The worst part of it
Page 5: all was that he never even seem to notice I was there. No one did.

Months went by after meeting this tall black man. I notice people would always look away from him. He was treated the same way I was. They would run in fear not even looking at either of 
Page 6: us. It was sad.

I decided to travel the lands. Far and wide, leaving trails of coldness in my wake.

Until one day, I encountered the place where I would meet my demise.

It was warm. It felt 
Page 7: wonderful on my face. 
All at once, I felt love and joy and as if life was worth living.

However, the further I travelled into this new land, I seemed to shrink. I lost weight. 

Not knowing what to do, I wandered looking for friends, someone that
Page 8: would help me, someone that would accept me for who I am and tell me everything would be okay.

This new land brought many friends. I wasn't alone anymore.
I met a man the same colour as me. He carried a bow everywhere he went.
Page 9: He did not seem to trust anyone.
I met a green man who had no arms. He talked like a snake and he walked on all fours. 

We had little to no conversations. I barely understood him. But he seemed to be lonely too.
Page 10: On the day of my demise, I saw a ball of light in the heavens. Just like the day I was born.

But it was hot. Soon, I was nothing. And nothing was me.
Scrambling to pick up my pieces, but they fell through my hands.
Page 11: And just like the day I was born, my memory of the day I died was like I just disappeared into nothingness.

Now all I see is darkness...
Never to know where that tall black man went.

Page 0: To Murder an Innocent Bird
By Hunter Lee

The tale of a sociopath, his life accomplishments and how he felt about it.

"It's gruesome, but hits so close to home."
-Disney Princesses
Page 1: Being born and raised in a secluded home deep within the forest, Jack's form of entertainment was to shoot things with his shotgun.

As a child, he'd shoot tin cans off the roof.
As a teen, he'd go hunting with his father in the woods.
Page 2: All his life, Jack knew nothing about anything but shooting.

There's a lot of things he could shoot. A tin can, a deer, a bear, a tree, another tree.

Until one day, Jack noticed a bird's nest sitting snugly between two branches in a 
Page 3: tree. This nest had a momma bird, a papa bird and a whole carton of eggs.

Now, Jack hadn't had any breakfast that morning. He felt hungry.

He pulled out his shotgun and aimed at the momma bird.
Page 4: While aiming, he thought to himself, how would the hatchlings live without momma bird.

Before he knew it, he pulled the trigger and BAM! Momma bird fell to the ground.

Papa bird flew away, leaving his nest of eggs unguarded.
Page 5: Jack felt bad for shooting momma bird. So he climbed up the tree to make sure her eggs were fine.

Not long after, papa bird returned to the nest.

He saw Jack sitting nearby by a campfire he had set up.
Page 6: He flew down next to Jack and noticed the broken shells.

Jack looked straight into papa birds eyes. He saw them tearing up as Jack was making an omlette.

Jack thought to himself "What more does papa bird have to live for?
Page 7: What have I done?"

So he pulled out his shotgun and shot papa bird.

Later that night, Jack had a feast.

       WOODEN AXE

           SEX

        DIARIES




         Secret!  xxoxo
Page 1: It was a Friday in which I returned from mining and what not. I smelled like death. I returned home. (Insert favorite female Wooden Axe player) followed behind, trying to block out the stench. I placed all my minerals in my chests.
Page 2: and let the water run to get warm.  Had cleaned myself and removed the stench, drained the water and let it fill up again.  was gonna relax in the bath when suddenly I felt a body behind me and turned and saw (PLAYER).
Page 3: in my bathroom. She then started to kiss me and touch me in places, so sensational. (PLAYER) then proceeded to strip herself down and kiss me more. I was erect...and I was trying my best to stop it. 
Page 4: She then proceeded to grind on me I felt her warm body...and she was wet.We then started to kiss, not holding back. We then proceeded to the shower. She couldn't stand to be in rain and oceans and rivers 
Page 5: but this was a little different. I then started to massage her breasts. She moaned in pleasure. The warm water hitting our backs and us being on top of each other, I couldn't resist.
Page 6: After the water was drained we then proceeded to our bedroom where we both laid down and started to kiss each other with joy.  I  looked at her beautiful body then knelt forward to her 
Page 7: womanly parts and started to lick her clitoris. She moaned deeply making me want her more than I already did. She told me to stop and in that instant I did.   I laid down next to her when suddenly she sat on me, bouncing,
Page 8: I then felt something cold in her. I slid fingers into her, earning a loud moan of pleasure and took out what seemed to be a pearl." Look what I got"   I said looking at her giving her a teasing look. 
Page 9: She  had gotten up and started to grind against me some more, in attempt to try and tease me. It worked and I was wanting her more and more every second.

Page 0: WA Specific Rules;

DISCLAIMERS -
The lights on the di will not be even, if you want to fix it go ahead, but I'm too lazy.

You will have to press the di button (Nether brick) twice to simulate two dice rolls.

Page 1: IT WILL BE EXTREMELY EASY TO CHEAT IN THIS GAME. If you want to play, TRY to play with people you think would HOPEFULLY not cheat. Even though that will be pretty tough to do.

If items are stolen from the containers, I will try to eventually replace them
Page 2: Rules;

1. Pick your color and remove the wool from the chest. This will be used to show ownership, houses, and hotels. Place the wool between the iron pressure plates for each of these. 1=ownership, 2-5=houses, (cont'd)
Page 3: 2-high on middle=hotel.

2. Take one row of money from the money chest. (5 of $1,$5,$10 - 6 of $20 - 2 of $50,$100,$200).

3. Play like regular monopoly.

4. ????????
Page 4: 5, 3 rolls of doubles DO mean instant jail. 

6. Chance, Community Chest and GO all warrant ONE press of the buttons for an item. The special GO money blocks can be exchanged at the bank if desired.
Page 5: 7. The chest cart that goes around the board is for transferring money. Just flip the switch at the desired location and the cart will stop there. 

8. If I stop playing again and someone needs special perms, just post on the forums.
Page 6: Anything else, just ask/refer to original monopoly rules. 

Yes this may breed arguments and name-calling, but that is all in the aim of keeping the true heart of monopoly.

I guess that's it...
