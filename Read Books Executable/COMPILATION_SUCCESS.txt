  READ BOOKS EXECUTABLE - COMPILATION SUCCESS
================================================================================

Date: October 20, 2025
Status: ✓ SUCCESSFULLY COMPILED AND TESTED

================================================================================
  SUMMARY
================================================================================

The "Read Books Executable" project has been successfully compiled into a
working JAR file: ReadSignsAndBooks.jar

This old Java project (circa 2018) reads Minecraft books and signs from world
region files and player data, extracting them to text files for backup or
documentation purposes.

================================================================================
  WHAT WAS DONE
================================================================================

1. ANALYZED PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - Identified Eclipse project with Java 7/8 source code
   - Found dependency on json-20180130.jar
   - Located source files in src/ directory

2. FIXED ENCODING ISSUES
   - Replaced corrupted Minecraft color code characters (§) with Unicode
     escape sequences (\u00A7)
   - Added UTF-8 encoding flag to compilation process

3. CREATED BUILD SYSTEM
   - MANIFEST.MF - JAR manifest file
   - build.ps1 - PowerShell build script
   - build.bat - Windows batch build script

4. CREATED RUN SCRIPTS
   - run.ps1 - PowerShell run script with error checking
   - run.bat - Windows batch run script with error checking

5. CREATED DOCUMENTATION
   - README.md - Complete user guide
   - BUILD_NOTES.md - Technical build information
   - COMPILATION_SUCCESS.txt - This file

6. TESTED SUCCESSFULLY
   - Compiled without errors (only warnings about obsolete Java 8 target)
   - JAR file created: 61,317 bytes
   - Successfully executed and created output files

================================================================================
  HOW TO USE
================================================================================

TO BUILD:
  Windows PowerShell:  .\build.ps1
  Windows Batch:       build.bat

TO RUN:
  Windows PowerShell:  .\run.ps1
  Windows Batch:       run.bat
  Direct:              java -jar ReadSignsAndBooks.jar

REQUIREMENTS:
  - Java 8 or higher (tested with Java 21)
  - json-20180130.jar (included)
  - region/ folder with Minecraft world files
  - playerdata/ folder with player data files

OUTPUT FILES:
  - bookOutput.txt - All books found in the world
  - signOutput.txt - All signs found in the world
  - playerdataOutput.txt - Books from player inventories

================================================================================
  FILES CREATED/MODIFIED
================================================================================

MODIFIED:
  src/Main.java (line 29) - Fixed character encoding

NEW FILES:
  MANIFEST.MF
  build.ps1
  build.bat
  run.ps1
  run.bat
  README.md
  BUILD_NOTES.md
  COMPILATION_SUCCESS.txt
  ReadSignsAndBooks.jar (compiled output)

================================================================================
  TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

Compiler: javac 21.0.8
Target: Java 8 bytecode (for maximum compatibility)
Encoding: UTF-8
Main Class: Main
Dependencies: json-20180130.jar
Output: ReadSignsAndBooks.jar (61 KB)

Compilation Warnings (non-critical):
  - Bootstrap class path not set (expected with cross-compilation)
  - Source/target value 8 is obsolete (but still supported)
  - Unchecked operations (legacy code, works fine)

================================================================================
  NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

The project is now fully functional and ready to use!

To use with your Minecraft world:
1. Copy your world's region files to the region/ folder
2. Copy player data files to the playerdata/ folder
3. Run: java -jar ReadSignsAndBooks.jar
4. Check the output text files for extracted content

For development:
- Source code is in src/
- Modify and rebuild with build.ps1 or build.bat
- The code is old but functional

================================================================================
  NOTES
================================================================================

This is a legacy project that still works perfectly for its intended purpose.
The code uses older Java patterns but is stable and functional. It supports
both modern Anvil (.mca) and older MCR (.mcr) region file formats.

The original developer created a useful tool for Minecraft server admins and
players to backup and search through written content in their worlds.
